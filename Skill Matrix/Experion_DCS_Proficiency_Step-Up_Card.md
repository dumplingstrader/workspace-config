## Assessment Guidelines

### How to Use This Step-Up Card

1. **Review all competencies** at each level with the employee
2. **Identify demonstrated capabilities** based on actual work performance
3. **Consider time in role** but prioritize demonstrated competency
4. **Look for consistent performance** across multiple task categories
5. **Assign the highest level** where employee meets 80%+ of criteria
6. **Document gaps** for development planning

### Assessment Tips

- **Don't over-rate based on potential** - Rate current demonstrated performance
- **Require evidence** - Use specific examples of tasks performed
- **Consider complexity** - Independent work on simple tasks ≠ Level 3 if complex tasks require guidance
- **Differentiate "has done" from "can do consistently"** - One-time performance with heavy support ≠ proficiency
- **Factor in decision quality** - Did the solution work? Was it optimal? Did it follow standards?

### Red Flags for Over-Rating

- Employee cannot explain *why* they performed a task a certain way
- Frequent quality issues or rework required
- Heavy reliance on specific individuals for guidance
- Avoids certain tasks within the skill area
- Lacks theoretical understanding behind practical tasks

### Development Path Indicators

**From 1 to 2:** Focus on supervised task repetition and procedure following  
**From 2 to 3:** Reduce supervision, encourage problem-solving, assign increasing complexity  
**From 3 to 4:** Assign troubleshooting leadership, involve in design reviews, formal training role  
**From 4 to 5:** Multi-site projects, standards development, external engagement, strategic initiatives
