6. Promotion Narrative: "I Am Already Operating as the Site Lead Process Controls Engineer"

*(A complete, ready-to-use justification for your promotion packet.)*

### Executive Summary

Over the past several yearsaccelerating significantly in 2024 and 2025I have moved well beyond the responsibilities of a Senior Process Controls Engineer and have consistently operated as the **Site Lead Process Controls Engineer** for Carson and Wilmington. My work now spans full system ownership, corporate-level alarm governance, SIS lifecycle integration, cross-site SME engagement, vendor/contract strategy, and training and development for the next generation of controls engineers.

My technical contributions have prevented production risk, strengthened Alarm & SIS governance, improved APC and DCS reliability, and streamlined multi-year budgets and licensing across multiple platforms. I also routinely lead cross-functional problem-solving, onboard new engineers, engage with corporate Tiger Teams, represent the refinery at Honeywell Users Group, and manage critical vendor relationships.

The breadth, depth, and leadership of my work align directly with MPC's defined expectations for a **Site Lead Process Controls Engineer**, and my impact demonstrates that I am already performing in that role today.

### 1. I Provide Site-Level Technical Leadership Across All Control System Platforms

A **Site Lead PCS Engineer** is expected to act as the site steward for major platforms. In 2025, I assumed end-to-end ownership for:

**Integrity (LARINT01)  Full Platform Ownership**
* Rebuilt SFTP/FTP scheduling, SQL rights, and EPKS import pipelines
* Corrected multi-year asset mapping issues for PLC, SIS, vibration, and GTG systems
* Established complete backup strategies for LCN and EPKS environments
* Led Integrity upgrade (7.3.1), coordinated PAS/Hexagon architecture

**Result:** Integrity is now stable, predictable, and audit-ready  a required condition for SIS/MOC compliance and a core Site Lead responsibility.

**Alarm Management (DynAMo/ACM)  Enterprise-Level SME**
* Led suppressed/active sync rebuilds
* Solved ReceivedDelay issues and collector ACT-file consumption
* Drove alarm panel consistency across two refineries
* Served as primary SME for Salt Lake City, Detroit, Anacortes, and El Paso

**Result:** MPC now uses a consistent, reliable alarm governance foundation—directly shaped by my work.

**GE Mark VIe Platform Leadership**
* Led GTG software modifications, controller spares, graphics issues, and fan failures
* Performed EWS setup, licensing, and recurring turbine troubleshooting

**Result:** Reduced GTG unreliability and restored consistent operation of critical generation assets.

This level of cross-platform stewardship is aligned with **Site Lead PCS expectations**.

### 2. I Influence Corporate Alarm Management Standards

I am not just solving local alarm problems—I am shaping MPC's approach to Alarm Management.

**Direct contributions:**
* Active member of the MPC Alarm Management Tiger Team
* Standardized System Alarm Metrics & Messages for refinery-wide monitoring
* Proposed and validated fixes adopted by multiple sites
* Provided ACM/DynAMo expertise to corporate DEs and Honeywell escalation teams
* Supported Alarm CAB, OPM, and conditional alarming modernization

**Result:** The alarm system is now more accurate, more synchronized, and more operator-trustworthy than at any time in recent history.

This type of corporate-level influence is explicitly described in MPC's definition of a **Site Lead PCS Engineer**.

### 3. I Strengthen SIS Lifecycle Governance and Safety-MOC Readiness

**Site Lead PCS Engineers** must safeguard the safety systems. I have taken a major role in:

**SIS Training & Capability Building**
* Delivered Safety Manager 4550/4551 coursework
* Developed and powered up the Trident SIS Trainer
* Ran multiple SIS training cycles and vendor coordination

**Integrity – SIS Data Governance**
* Integrated SIS, PLC, Triconex, Safety Manager, and vibration data into Integrity
* Ensured collection files, tag mapping, SQL rights, and schedules were compliant
* Re-established audit-ready evidence chains

**Result:** Our SIS ecosystem is better documented, better trained, and more aligned with MOC and audit expectations.

### 4. I Lead Major Infrastructure, Reliability, and Modernization Efforts

**Site Lead PCS Engineers** are expected to initiate and execute refinery-wide modernization work. I have been a key driver of:

* C2H Old Data Center Renovation (multi-year)
* Environmental & Lab Room upgrades (2024–2025)
* Wilmington/Carson PSA and Analyzer HMI upgrades
* Coker HMI modernization
* GE Mark VIe turbine system health checks
* System alarm monitoring integration (PI + DCS + ACM)
* VMware licensing (multi-year cycle)
* E-waste programs (Carson + Wilmington)

**Result:** Improved reliability, reduced risk of obsolescence, and created a clearer modernization path for the next 5–10 years.

### 5. I Manage Vendor Contracts, Licensing, and Multi-Year Budgets

A Site Lead is responsible for business and financial leadership.

In 2024–2025 alone, I managed:
* 2025–2029 PCG budget
* Honeywell multi-year license renewals
* Schneider CFA contract
* GE cycle renewals and spares strategy
* Prognost and Trimark service contracts
* Multi-vendor POs, BPOs, and GRs
* PR process optimization with Supply Chain

**Result:** Zero licensing lapses, clearer spend forecasting, and stronger vendor accountability.

This financial ownership is a hallmark of the **Site Lead PCS role**.

### 6. I Mentor, Train, and Onboard the Next Generation of Controls Engineers

I provide structured development for new and existing team members—another **Site Lead PCS expectation**.

**Key contributions:**
* Onboarded new hires (ACM, DynAMo, Integrity, conditional alarming, point deletion)
* Delivered Python training, PLC5/SLC500, SIS courses
* Supported vendor classes and training logistics
* Provided 1:1 mentoring for engineers and technicians
* Created reusable troubleshooting guides and lab environments

**Result:** Faster engineer ramp-up, stronger internal talent pipeline, and higher overall controls capability.

### 7. I Regularly Represent the Refinery as a Technical Leader

Across multiple areas, I serve as the engineering face of the refinery.

**Examples:**
* HUG (Honeywell Users Group) presentations & follow-ups (2024–2025)
* PCE Interview Panels
* Cross-refinery F2F meetings
* APC/Honeywell architecture reviews
* Vendor collaboration (Honeywell, Schneider, GE, PAS/Hexagon, UOP, Drake Controls)
* Site representation in cross-functional meetings (Ops, OT, Safety, IT, APC)

**Result:** Improved vendor performance, better decision-making alignment, and stronger organizational trust in Process Controls.

### 8. I Handle the Most Complex, High-Risk Technical Issues

Turbines, Coker modules, slow graphics, SCADA reconfigurations, NTLMv2 failures, service account outages, suppressed alarms, ACT floods, DCOM failures, and more.

**Outcome:**
The refinery consistently avoids prolonged downtime, alarm failures, and control system degradation — because I step in to diagnose and lead resolution.

This reliability leadership is a defining expectation for a **Site Lead PCS Engineer**.

### Conclusion: I Am Already Operating at the Site Lead Level

Across platform ownership, safety system governance, alarm management strategy, budget leadership, cross-site SME support, training, and high-risk troubleshooting — my work consistently demonstrates **Site Lead-level scope, influence, and results**.

I have:
* Taken on responsibilities that exceed the Senior PCS role
* Delivered refinery-wide and multi-site technical improvements
* Influenced MPC's corporate alarm governance strategy
* Led critical training, onboarding, and succession efforts
* Owned major vendor, licensing, and budget decisions
* Driven multi-year modernization efforts
* Consistently provided leadership beyond my formal title

My actual contributions align fully with MPC's definition of a **Site Lead Process Controls Engineer**, and formalizing this role would enable me to continue driving refinery-wide strategic improvements, mentor the next generation of engineers, and expand MPC's technical maturity.
