# Talking Points - Site Lead PCS Engineer Discussion (1/30/26)
**UPDATED: Reflects This is Step 1 of 4-Step Process**

---

## Pre-Meeting Mindset

**Remember GT's Email Signals:**
- ✅ This is about **earning their recommendation**, not getting immediate approval
- ✅ They expect to find gaps (make them small and addressable, not fundamental)
- ✅ PCG Technologist alignment is required before anything goes to Chris
- ✅ "Not as black and white from a checklist" = story and impact matter more than competencies alone
- ✅ They're genuinely interested ("Looking forward to you presenting a case though!")

**This Meeting's Purpose:**
- **NOT:** Get promoted today
- **NOT:** Get their final decision
- **YES:** Present strong case and earn their recommendation to next level
- **YES:** Identify specific gaps so you can address them
- **YES:** Understand the full path forward (Steps 2, 3, 4)

---

## Opening Statement (2-3 minutes)

### Version A: Confident but Humble
**"Thank you all for making time for this discussion. Based on GT's email, I understand this is the first step in a multi-stage process, and my goal today is to earn your recommendation—whether that's to work on development areas you identify or to move the conversation to the PCG Technologist and eventually Chris.**

**I've prepared a case for why I believe I'm operating at Site Lead level already—spanning multi-site technical authority, corporate governance, budget ownership, crisis leadership, and talent development. I'll walk you through the evidence, and then I'd like your honest assessment of where I stand and what gaps you see.**

**I'm not asking for special treatment or shortcuts. I'm asking for your guidance on the path forward and, ideally, your recommendation that I'm ready for the next conversation."**

### Version B: More Direct
**"Thanks for taking this meeting. GT, you mentioned this role is difficult to achieve and requires everyone to be aligned. I respect that. My goal today isn't to convince you to promote me on the spot—it's to present the strongest case I can and earn your recommendation to continue this conversation with the PCG Technologist and Chris.**

**I'll show you evidence that I'm already performing at Lead level, and then I want your honest feedback on gaps so we can build a plan together."**

**Choose the version that feels most authentic to you.**

## Strategic Questions to Ask Them

### Understanding Their View of the Role
**"Before I dive into evidence, I want to make sure I understand the role correctly. When you think about the Site Lead PCS Engineer, what are the top 3-5 expectations you have?"**

*Why this matters:* Confirms alignment before you present. If they emphasize something you haven't covered, you can adjust on the fly.

---

**"How do you see the Lead role working with the PCG Technologist? What's the division of responsibility?"**

*Why this matters:* Shows strategic thinking about organizational structure, not just your promotion.

---

### Gap Identification (Critical Section)
**"Based on what you've seen in my work over the past 18-24 months, where do you see gaps between my performance and Lead-level expectations?"**

*Why this matters:* Direct question forces them to be specific. Take detailed notes.

**Follow-up if they're vague:** *"Can you help me understand what that looks like in practice? What would success in that area look like?"*

---

**"Is this a readiness question, a timing question, or an organizational design question?"**

*Why this matters:* 
- **Readiness:** You need to develop specific skills → Ask for development plan
- **Timing:** Role/budget not ready yet → Ask for timeline
- **Organizational design:** They're still figuring out what Lead means → Offer to help shape it

---

**"If I address the gaps we've discussed, what's a realistic timeline to revisit this conversation?"**

*Why this matters:* Sets expectations for Step 2 timing.

---

### Next Steps Clarity
**"What do you need from me to feel confident making a recommendation to the PCG Technologist?"**

*Why this matters:* Gets them thinking about recommending you, not just evaluating you.

---

**"Should I plan to present directly to the PCG Technologist, or would you prefer to frame the conversation on my behalf first?"**

*Why this matters:* Shows respect for their role as advocates and helps you prepare for Step 2.

---

**"Are there other stakeholders who should be involved in this conversation that we haven't mentioned?"**

*Why this matters:* Uncovers any surprises (e.g., "Actually, we need Operations leadership's input too").

---

## Handling Specific Pushback

### "You haven't been in the Senior role long enough"
**Response:** *"I understand tenure matters. Many Senior Engineers spend 3-5 years at this level before advancing. What I'd ask you to consider is the scope and complexity of what I've taken on—not just time in role. Over the past 18-24 months, I've operated at Lead-level responsibility across multi-site ownership, corporate governance, budget management, and crisis leadership. If someone demonstrated Lead-level performance for this duration, what would make you comfortable recommending them?"*

**Key phrase:** *"I'm not asking based on time served—I'm asking based on scope and impact delivered."*

---

### "You need more corporate visibility or influence"
**Response:** *"That's helpful feedback. Can you help me understand what corporate influence looks like in practice? I'm actively contributing to the Tiger Team, supporting Salt Lake City, Detroit, and Anacortes on DynAMo deployments, and representing MPC at HUG. Where do you see specific gaps—is it relationships with certain people, participation in specific forums, or something else?"*

**Follow-up:** *"If it's about building more relationships, I'm happy to take on additional cross-site projects or corporate initiatives. What would you recommend?"*

---

### "The PCG Technologist needs to be aligned before we can move forward"
**Response:** *"Absolutely. I understand the importance of their input. What's the best way to engage them? Should I present my case directly to them, or would you prefer to have an initial conversation to frame it first? I want to make sure we approach this thoughtfully."*

**Follow-up:** *"Are there specific areas where you think they'd have concerns? I'd like to be prepared to address those."*

---

### "This role is new—we're still defining what it looks like"
**Response:** *"I understand, and that's partly why I wanted to have this conversation. Over the past 18-24 months, I've been filling gaps that a Lead would naturally own—multi-site coordination, corporate governance, vendor strategy, training programs. If we're designing this role, let's start with the problems that need solving. I've been solving many of them already."*

**Key phrase:** *"I can help shape what this role should be based on the work that's already needed."*

---

### "We're concerned about [specific technical area]"
**Response:** *"Thanks for being specific. Help me understand what depth you're looking for in that area."*

**If you have experience:** Share relevant examples  
**If you don't:** *"If that's a gap, what's a reasonable path to build that experience? Are there upcoming projects where I could take lead? I'm committed to continuous learning."*

**Follow-up:** *"Is this a requirement for the role, or a nice-to-have? If it's critical, I want to prioritize it."*

---

### "There are budget/headcount constraints"
**Response:** *"I understand budget is always a consideration. What I'd point out is that I'm already doing Lead-level work—this is about aligning the title and compensation with the scope I'm handling, not creating a new position. Consider the value I've delivered: LARINT01 rebuild saved $150K+, vendor negotiations, training programs that reduce contractor dependency."*

**Follow-up:** *"Is this a timing issue—like waiting until the next budget cycle—or a fundamental constraint?"*

---

### "We need to see more people leadership experience"
**Response:** *"People leadership is critical, and I'm still developing those skills. Here's what I've been doing: onboarding new engineers with structured training, 1:1 mentorship, training delivery across multiple technical domains, and cross-functional collaboration with Ops, IT, Safety, and vendors. I see people leadership as enabling others to succeed—that's what I've been doing through training, documentation, and knowledge transfer."*

**Follow-up:** *"If there are specific leadership skills to develop, I'm open to formal training or coaching. What would you recommend?"*

---

### "Your peers haven't reached this level yet"
**Response:** *"I understand the need for fairness and team cohesion. What I'd say is that I'm not comparing myself to my peers—I'm asking to be evaluated on scope and impact. I'm managing multi-site responsibilities, corporate governance, vendor contracts, and training programs that are different from typical Senior Engineer work. If others are also performing at Lead level, they should be recognized too."*

**Key phrase:** *"Promotions should be based on scope and impact, not just tenure or peer comparison."*

---

## Closing Strategies

### If It Goes Well (They See Your Case)
**"Thank you for the feedback and discussion. Based on what we've talked about, what are the next steps? Do you need anything additional from me, or is this a matter of getting alignment with the PCG Technologist?"**

**Follow-up:** *"What's a realistic timeline for that conversation? I want to be prepared."*

---

### If Gaps Are Identified (Most Likely Scenario)
**"Thanks for the honest feedback—I really appreciate the specifics. I'd like to put together a development plan to address the gaps we discussed. Can we schedule a follow-up in [30/60/90 days] to review progress and revisit this conversation?"**

**Follow-up:** *"In the meantime, should I continue operating in this Lead capacity, or would you like me to adjust my focus?"*

---

### If It's Unclear (They're Still Figuring Out the Role)
**"I appreciate the discussion. It sounds like there's still some work to do in defining what the Lead role should be. What would be most helpful from me as you continue to clarify it? Should I document the work I'm currently doing to help inform that definition?"**

---

## What NOT to Say (Avoid These)

❌ **"I deserve this"** → Sounds entitled  
❌ **"I'm better than [peer name]"** → Undermines team  
❌ **"It's not fair"** → Comes across as immature  
❌ **"Other people do less and get promoted"** → Defensive and negative  
❌ **"If I don't get this, I'll leave"** → Ultimatum damages relationship  
❌ **"The role is mine to lose"** → Presumptuous  
❌ **"I've been doing this for years"** (if it's only 18-24 months) → Exaggeration hurts credibility
