## EMAIL DRAFT

**Subject:** Site Lead PCS Engineer Discussion - Development Plan & Next Steps

GT, Felix, Andy,

Thank you for the time and honest feedback yesterday. I appreciated the candid discussion and your clarity on the development areas that will strengthen my readiness for the Site Lead PCS Engineer role.

Based on our conversation, I heard four core themes:

1. **Visibility & Perception with Leadership** - Building cross-functional reputation beyond Process Controls, ensuring leadership sees my technical problem-solving contributions
2. **Follow-Through & Impact Communication** - Systematically closing the loop on initiatives, documenting impact, and enabling others as a "super user" teacher
3. **Technical Credibility & Hands-On Engagement** - Recent visibility in complex logic/loop design work, ensuring training effectiveness through structured follow-up
4. **Knowledge Systems & Scalability** - Making innovations evergreen, creating self-service documentation infrastructure, reducing dependency on me as the "historian"

I've put together a development plan to address these systematically:

---

### **Development Area 1: Visibility & Perception with Leadership**

**What I Heard:**
- Site Lead isn't just a checklist—it's about reputation and being the cross-functional "go-to" person
- Leadership should react: "He's not a 14 already?"
- Recent focus on systems/obsolescence means 5-6 years since I've been visibly credited with solving tough Process Controls problems
- I may help resolve fires behind the scenes but don't get credit for spearheading them

**Actions:**
- **DynAMo operational impact presentations** (30 days): Create 10-15 min presentation for Operations Area Team Leads showcasing alarm accuracy improvements and how my work impacts their units—information sharing, not bragging
- **Integrity project value demonstrations** (45 days): Present to Project/Contractor teams showing tools, methods, and operational impact—position as enabler/teacher
- **Proactive engagement in complex problem-solving** (Ongoing): Seek out opportunities during DCS cutovers to sit in on complex loop designs during FAT/SATs—rebuild visibility in hands-on technical work

**Timeline:** 30-60 days for initial presentations, ongoing engagement throughout 2026  
**Success Metric:** Operations Team Leads and project teams can articulate how my work impacts them; receive unsolicited requests for consultation on complex technical problems

---

### **Development Area 2: Follow-Through & Impact Communication**

**What I Heard:**
- Systematic follow-through will benefit the entire team
- After creating tools/documentation, I need to check in with users to ensure they know the impact
- Need to promote myself strategically without appearing self-promotional

**Actions:**
- **Systematic post-delivery follow-up** (30 days): After every DynAMo/Integrity presentation, schedule 2-week and 30-day check-ins to ask: Are you using the tools? Do you need more training/help?
- **Impact documentation loop** (Ongoing): When helping solve problems, create One Page Lessons (OPLs) or Tool Tips, distribute to Process Controls group and relevant stakeholders, then follow up with users to confirm value received

**Timeline:** 30-day system implementation, ongoing execution throughout 2026  
**Success Metric:** Users proactively report using tools/methods; documented evidence of follow-through in project close-outs

---

### **Development Area 3: Technical Credibility & Hands-On Engagement**

**What I Heard:**
- Haven't been credited with logic and complex loop design work recently
- I've set up extensive Process Controls training but lack follow-through: Did participants understand? Should we do refresher training with labs? How do we test understanding?

**Actions:**
- **FAT/SAT participation in DCS cutovers** (Ongoing): Proactively reach out to Area PCEs (or invite them to seek me out) to sit in on complex loop design sessions during upcoming cutover projects—rebuild hands-on technical reputation
- **Training effectiveness system** (60 days): Implement post-training assessment: competency checks, refresher training with hands-on labs, follow-up surveys on knowledge retention
- **Mentor-led problem-solving sessions** (Ongoing): When Area PCEs face complex technical challenges, position myself as first call for collaborative troubleshooting—document resolutions as OPLs

**Timeline:** 60 days for training system implementation, ongoing FAT/SAT and problem-solving engagement  
**Success Metric:** Area PCEs proactively invite me to design reviews; training participants demonstrate competency in follow-up assessments; documented examples of leading complex technical problem resolution

---

### **Development Area 4: Knowledge Systems & Scalability**

**What I Heard:**
- I'm the "historian"—people ask me where documentation is because it's buried
- Need to make innovations evergreen and easily usable across MPC
- Should create SharePoint or other platforms so people don't have to ask me where things are

**Actions:**
- **SharePoint knowledge repository** (90 days): Build organized, searchable Process Controls knowledge base on SharePoint with categories: Training Materials, OPLs/Tool Tips, Platform Documentation, Vendor Contacts, Standards/Procedures—train team on how to search and contribute
- **Tool sustainability documentation** (60 days): For each major innovation/tool I've created (DynAMo methods, Integrity tools, etc.), create "How to Use" and "How to Maintain" guides so they're not dependent on me—identify backup owners
- **Self-service first, ask second culture** (Ongoing): When people ask me where documentation is, respond with: "Here's how to find it in SharePoint" + add it to SharePoint if missing—train people to fish rather than give them fish

**Timeline:** 60-90 days for infrastructure, ongoing culture shift throughout 2026  
**Success Metric:** Reduction in "where is this document?" questions; others contribute to knowledge base; tools remain functional when I'm unavailable; MPC sites beyond Anacortes adopt my innovations

---

### **Acknowledgment: Perception as the 7th Criterion**

I also heard clearly that Site Lead isn't solely about technical competencies—it's about perception and reputation. The expectation is that when my name comes up, the reaction should be: "He's not a 14 already?" and that people across the site (not just Process Controls) naturally seek me out for problem-solving and guidance.

I understand this isn't achieved through a single meeting or checklist—it's built through sustained visibility, consistent follow-through, and cross-functional impact over time. The development plan above is designed to systematically build that reputation and perception while continuing to deliver Lead-level performance.

---

### **Next Steps**

I propose we schedule a **90-day follow-up meeting (early May 2026)** to review progress on these development areas. In the meantime, I'll continue delivering Lead-level performance on LARINT01 platform ownership, corporate alarm governance, obsolescence strategy, and budget management while executing this development plan.

Please let me know if I've captured the development areas accurately or if there are additional focus areas I should prioritize. I'm committed to closing these gaps and proving I'm ready for your advocacy.

Thanks again for your support, guidance, and honest feedback.

Tony
