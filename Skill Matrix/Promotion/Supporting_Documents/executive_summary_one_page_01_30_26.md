## Request

I am seeking your assessment of my readiness for the Site Lead Process Controls Engineer role and guidance on the path forward—whether that's a development plan to close gaps or recommendation to the PCG Technologist and Chris.

---

## The Case in One Sentence

Over the past 18-24 months, my responsibilities have expanded far beyond the Senior PCS Engineer role into full Site Lead scope—multi-site technical authority, corporate governance, budget/vendor ownership, crisis leadership, and talent development—and I'm requesting formal recognition of this leadership.

## Addressing Potential Concerns

**"The role is new—we're still defining it"**  
→ I can help shape what this role should be based on the work I'm already doing

**"You need more corporate visibility"**  
→ Active Tiger Team contributor, multi-site SME, HUG representative. Where do you see specific gaps?

**"You haven't been in Senior long enough"**  
→ I've been performing Lead-level responsibilities for 18-24 months. What tenure benchmark should I target?

**"We need PCG Technologist alignment"**  
→ Absolutely. What's the best process to engage them? Should I present directly or would you prefer to frame it first?

---

## What I'm Asking For Today

1. **Your Honest Assessment:** Where do I stand relative to Site Lead expectations?

2. **Specific Gap Identification:** What areas do you see as gaps? (Not vague concerns—actionable development items)

3. **Next Steps Clarity:**
   - **Option A:** Development plan with timeline and milestones to close gaps
   - **Option B:** Recommendation to PCG Technologist for alignment discussion
   - **Option C:** Direct recommendation to Chris (if you feel I'm ready)

---

## My Commitment

- If gaps exist, I'll build and execute a development plan
- Continued delivery of Lead-level performance throughout this process
- Open communication and receptiveness to feedback
- Focus on MPC's success and team development, not just title

---

## Closing

**I'm not asking to grow into the Site Lead role—I'm requesting formal recognition of the leadership I'm already providing to MPC every day.**

The title "Senior Process Controls Engineer" no longer reflects the scope, complexity, or impact of my work. Formalizing this role would enable clearer decision authority, strengthen vendor/cross-site relationships, support succession planning, and align responsibilities with organizational recognition.

**Thank you for considering this case. I'm ready for your feedback.**
