- Review each gap scenario
- Practice your responses out loud
- Be ready to pivot based on what they actually say

**During the Meeting:**
- Listen first—don't assume you know their concerns
- Take notes on their exact words
- Ask clarifying questions before responding

**After the Meeting:**
- Address the specific gaps they identified (not what you guessed)
- Build a concrete development plan

## Most Likely Gaps (Based on GT's Email)

### Gap #1: "You Haven't Been in Senior Role Long Enough"

**Why They Might Say This:**
- MPC culture values tenure and "paying dues"
- They want to avoid perception of favoritism or rushing promotions
- Concern that you lack depth/breadth that comes with time
- Worry about demoralizing peers who've been Senior longer

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Acknowledge tenure matters** → **Reframe to scope and complexity** → **Provide specific evidence** → **Ask clarifying question**

**Response Template:**
*"I understand the concern. Many Senior Engineers spend 3-5 years at this level before advancing, and I respect that. What I'd ask you to consider is the scope and complexity of what I've taken on—not just time in role. Over the past 18-24 months, I've operated at Lead-level responsibility:*

- *LARINT01 rebuild (crisis leadership requiring deep expertise and cross-functional coordination)*
- *Multi-site ownership (Carson, Wilmington + supporting 3 external sites)*
- *Corporate Tiger Team (enterprise-level influence)*
- *Budget/vendor management ($2M+ annual licensing, multi-year strategic planning)*

*If someone demonstrated Lead-level performance for 18-24 months, what tenure would make you comfortable recommending them? Is there a specific duration you have in mind?"*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "I'm not asking based on time served—I'm asking based on scope and impact delivered"
- "The work I'm doing isn't Senior-level work—it's Lead-level work that's already happening"
- "I'm not asking to grow into the role—I'm asking for recognition of the leadership I'm already providing"

**If They Push Back Further:**
*"I hear you. If timing is the primary concern, what would you need to see over the next 6-12 months to feel confident? I want to make sure we're aligned on the path forward."*

---

### Gap #2: "You Need More Corporate-Level Influence"

**Why They Might Say This:**
- Lead Engineers need visibility/credibility beyond the site
- Concern you haven't built enough relationships with corporate teams, other sites, executives
- They see this as organizational influence, not just technical skill

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Acknowledge importance** → **Provide evidence of current influence** → **Ask for specifics** → **Offer to expand**

**Response Template:**
*"I absolutely agree—corporate influence is critical for this role. Here's what I've been building:*

- *Alarm Tiger Team: Active contributor, proposed solutions adopted at multiple refineries*
- *Multi-site SME: Primary technical contact for DynAMo deployments (5 sites)*
- *HUG participation: Authored whitepapers, presented industry research representing MPC*
- *IC F2F: Driving company-wide innovation and knowledge sharing*
- *DynAMo deployment standard: Creating fleet-wide benchmark methodology*
- *Cross-functional value: Demonstrable impact across Area Engineers, Systems Group, Operations, Corporate/Enterprise, and Leadership (Slides 10-11 detail this)*

*Can you help me understand where you see gaps in corporate influence? Is it visibility with specific people, participation in certain forums, or something else? If it's about building more relationships, I'm happy to take on additional cross-site projects or corporate initiatives."*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "I've been building corporate influence through alarm governance and multi-site support"
- "Help me understand what additional visibility would strengthen the case"
- "I'm actively representing MPC at Tiger Team, HUG, and with vendors—what am I missing?"

**Specific Follow-up Questions:**
- "Are there specific corporate teams or leaders I should be engaging with?"
- "Should I be participating in different forums or committees?"
- "Would you recommend I increase my travel to other sites to build those relationships?"

---

### Gap #3: "The PCG Technologist Needs to Be Aligned Before We Can Proceed"

**Why They Might Say This:**
- This is a new role structure—PCG Technologist may have opinions on timing, readiness, org structure
- They don't want to recommend something that gets blocked higher up
- They're testing whether you understand organizational dynamics

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Acknowledge need for alignment** → **Show respect for process** → **Clarify next steps** → **Ask about concerns**

**Response Template:**
*"Absolutely. I understand the PCG Technologist's input is critical to this decision. What's the best way to engage them? Should I schedule a separate discussion to present my case, or would you prefer to have an initial conversation with them to frame it first?*

*I want to make sure everyone who needs to be at the table is involved. Are there specific areas where you think they'd have concerns? I'd like to be prepared to address those proactively."*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "I respect the need for organizational alignment"
- "What's the best process for getting their input?"
- "Should I present directly to them, or would you prefer to frame it first?"

**Important: This is NOT a Gap You Can Fix**
This is a process requirement, not a readiness issue. Your goal:
- Show understanding of organizational dynamics
- Demonstrate willingness to engage with PCG Technologist
- Get clarity on timeline and process for that engagement

**Follow-up Questions:**
- "Who is the PCG Technologist, and what's their typical involvement in these decisions?"
- "What's a realistic timeline for getting on their calendar?"
- "Should I prepare the same materials I've shown you today, or would they want something different?"

---

### Gap #4: "The Role is New—We're Still Defining What It Looks Like"

**Why They Might Say This:**
- They're genuinely uncertain about the charter, scope, expectations
- Concern that promoting someone before the role is defined could create problems
- They're not confident explaining to Chris why this role exists

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Acknowledge uncertainty** → **Reframe as opportunity** → **Provide evidence of work that needs doing** → **Offer to help shape it**

**Response Template:**
*"I understand this is a new position, and that adds complexity. That's partly why I wanted to have this conversation—I can help shape what this role should be based on the work I'm already doing.*

*Over the past 18-24 months, I've been filling gaps that a Lead would naturally own:*
- *Multi-site coordination and SME support*
- *Corporate governance (alarm management, standards development)*
- *Vendor strategy and contract management*
- *Training programs and team capability building*
- *Crisis leadership and high-complexity technical problem solving*

*What are the most critical needs you're trying to address with this position? Let's work backward from the problems that need solving—I've been solving many of them already."*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "If we're designing this role, let's start with the problems that need solving"
- "I can help define what the Lead role should be based on the work that's already needed"
- "The role may be new to the org chart, but the work has been happening—it just hasn't been formalized"

**Opportunity to Propose:**
*"Would it be helpful if I documented the Lead-level work I'm currently doing? That could inform how we define the role formally."*

---

### Gap #5: "You Need More Experience with [Specific Technical Area]"

**Possible Technical Areas They Might Mention:**
- Advanced APC/optimization (beyond basic support)
- Larger capital projects (end-to-end ownership)
- Specific control systems (e.g., TDC migration, emerging technologies)
- Safety system audits/compliance (formal PSM experience)
- IT/OT convergence (deeper networking/cybersecurity)

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Don't argue—ask for specifics** → **Provide evidence if you have it** → **Development plan if you don't** → **Reframe criticality**

**Response Template:**
*"Thanks for being specific. Help me understand what depth you're looking for in [that area]."*

**If You Have Experience:**
*"I've worked on [specific examples]. For instance:*
- *[Example 1 with context and outcome]*
- *[Example 2 with context and outcome]*

*Is that the level of experience you're looking for, or are you thinking of something more extensive?"*

**If You Don't Have Experience:**
*"I appreciate you identifying that. If that's a gap, what's a reasonable path to build that experience? Are there upcoming projects where I could take lead? I'm committed to continuous learning and happy to prioritize this area.*

*One clarifying question: Is this a requirement for the role, or a nice-to-have? If it's critical, I want to make sure I'm focusing my development in the right direction."*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "Help me understand what success looks like in that area"
- "Is this a must-have for the role, or a future growth opportunity?"
- "What's a realistic timeline to build that experience?"

**Reframe if Needed:**
*"I'd also point out that the Lead role is about leadership and coordination across platforms, not necessarily being the deepest expert in every single technology. I'm strong across DCS, SIS, alarm management, and OT integration. Is [specific area] something the Lead needs to own personally, or coordinate with specialists?"*

---

### Gap #6: "We Need to See More People Leadership Experience"

**Why They Might Say This:**
- Lead Engineers often mentor multiple people, resolve conflicts, give difficult feedback
- Concern you're technically strong but may lack people management experience
- They haven't seen you in challenging people situations (e.g., performance issues, conflict resolution)

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Acknowledge importance** → **Provide evidence of what you've done** → **Development offer** → **Reframe what people leadership means**

**Response Template:**
*"People leadership is critical, and I'm committed to developing those skills. Here's what I've been doing:*

- *Structured onboarding: Built training program for new engineers (ACM, DynAMo, Integrity, Python, SIS, PLCs)*
- *1:1 mentorship: Provided technical guidance and career development coaching for 5+ engineers*
- *Training delivery: 200+ hours across multiple technical domains*
- *Cross-functional collaboration: Daily coordination with Ops, IT, Safety, Finance, Supply Chain—aligning stakeholders with different priorities*

*I see people leadership as enabling others to succeed and removing roadblocks. That's what I've been doing through training, documentation, and knowledge transfer.*

*If there are specific leadership skills you'd like me to develop—like formal coaching, conflict resolution, performance management—I'm open to training or mentorship. What would you recommend?"*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "I've been investing in people through training and mentorship"
- "People leadership is about enabling others—that's what structured onboarding and knowledge transfer accomplish"
- "What specific leadership competencies should I focus on developing?"

**If They Mention Formal Management:**
*"I understand that Lead roles often have dotted-line mentorship responsibilities rather than direct reports. Is the concern about formal people management, or about influencing and developing team members? I've been doing the latter—if it's the former, I'm happy to discuss how that would work."*

---

### Gap #7: "You're Too Valuable Where You Are—We Can't Afford to Promote You"

**Why They Might Say This:**
- You're the go-to person for critical systems
- Concern that promoting you means you'll stop doing hands-on work
- They're worried about losing technical capacity

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Appreciate recognition** → **Reframe the role** → **Clarify what won't change** → **Ask what they're worried about**

**Response Template:**
*"I appreciate that you value my technical contributions. What I'd clarify is that a Lead role doesn't mean I stop doing technical work—it means I'm recognized for the leadership and strategic work I'm already doing alongside it.*

*I'll continue to own Integrity, DynAMo, Mark VIe, Safety Manager, etc. The title change reflects the expanded scope, not a shift away from hands-on work. I'm not asking to move into management—I'm asking to formalize the technical leadership role I'm already playing.*

*What are you worried about losing if I'm promoted? Let's make sure we address that proactively."*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "This isn't about stepping away from technical work—it's about formalizing the leadership I'm already providing"
- "The Lead role is a senior technical position, not a management position"
- "I'll still be hands-on with critical systems—the title just reflects the broader scope I'm handling"

**Specific Reassurances:**
- "I'm not going to stop being the Integrity expert or the DynAMo SME"
- "I'll still be the escalation point for Mark VIe and SIS issues"
- "The training and mentorship I'm doing will continue—it's part of the Lead role"

---

### Gap #8: "There Are Budget or Headcount Constraints"

**Why They Might Say This:**
- Promoting you requires budget approval, salary increase
- Finance may push back on additional costs
- Org may not have "room" for another Lead

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Acknowledge budget reality** → **Business case for ROI** → **Cost avoidance** → **Ask about timing vs. constraint**

**Response Template:**
*"I understand budget is always a consideration. What I'd point out is that I'm already doing Lead-level work—this is about aligning the title and compensation with the scope I'm handling. It's not about creating a new position or adding new responsibilities.*

*Consider the value I've delivered:*
- *LARINT01 rebuild saved $150K+ in emergency replacement costs*
- *Vendor contract negotiations secured favorable terms*
- *Training programs reduce contractor dependency and accelerate new hire productivity (50% faster)*
- *Alarm management improvements drive operational efficiency (30-50% alarm reduction)*

*Is this a timing issue—like waiting until the next budget cycle—or a fundamental constraint on the position?"*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "I'm already doing Lead-level work—this is about recognizing it, not creating new scope"
- "The business case is cost avoidance and value delivery, not additional expense"
- "Is this a 'not now' or a 'not possible'?"

**If It's a Timing Issue:**
*"If budget cycle timing is the constraint, what's the right window to revisit this? Should we plan for Q2, Q3, or next fiscal year?"*

**If It's a Fundamental Constraint:**
*"If the org can't support a Lead position right now, what would need to change for that to be possible? Is it a matter of demonstrating continued ROI, or is there a structural issue we need to address?"*

---

### Gap #9: "Your Peers Haven't Reached This Level Yet"

**Why They Might Say This:**
- Concern about internal equity and team dynamics
- Other Senior Engineers may feel passed over or demoralized
- Org culture values tenure and "waiting your turn"

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Acknowledge fairness matters** → **Differentiate on scope, not superiority** → **Evidence of different work** → **Reframe criteria**

**Response Template:**
*"I understand the need for fairness and team cohesion. What I'd say is that I'm not claiming to be better than my peers—I'm saying the scope of my work has expanded into Lead-level territory that's different from typical Senior Engineer responsibilities.*

*I'm managing:*
- *Multi-site SME work (5 refineries, 15+ systems)*
- *Corporate governance (Tiger Team, alarm standards)*
- *Vendor contracts and multi-year budget ownership ($2M+ annual)*
- *Training program development and structured onboarding*
- *Crisis leadership (LARINT01 rebuild, Mark VIe restoration)*

*That's organizationally different from site-level technical support. If others are also performing at Lead level, they should be recognized too. My request isn't about comparison—it's about aligning title with scope.*

*If scope and impact drive promotions, how do we assess that objectively? I'm happy to be evaluated on those criteria."*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "Promotions should be based on scope and impact, not tenure alone"
- "I'm not saying I'm better than my peers—I'm saying the work I'm doing is structurally different"
- "If others are operating at Lead level, let's recognize them too"

**What NOT to Say:**
- ❌ "I'm the best engineer on the team"
- ❌ "Other people aren't doing as much"
- ❌ "I've been here longer than [peer name]"

---

### Gap #10: "We Need to See Sustained Performance, Not Just One Good Year"

**Why They Might Say This:**
- One strong year doesn't prove long-term capability
- They want to see consistency over time
- Concern that early success can be luck or timing

**Your Core Response Strategy:**
**Acknowledge sustained performance matters** → **Timeline evidence** → **Forward-looking commitment** → **Ask for milestones**

**Response Template:**
*"You're right—sustained performance matters. What I'd point out is that this isn't just one year. I started building toward this in 2023 (DynAMo pilot, Integrity admin work), ramped up significantly in 2024 (LARINT01 rebuild, Mark VIe, Tiger Team contributions), and continued through 2025 (multi-site SME, budget ownership, HUG participation). This is 18-24 months of consistent Lead-level delivery.*

*I'm committed to continuing this trajectory. If you need to see another 6-12 months of sustained performance, I understand—but I want clarity on what 'sustained' looks like so we're aligned.*

*What's the typical timeline you look for when evaluating someone for Lead? And what milestones would give you confidence that the performance is sustainable?"*

**Key Phrases to Use:**
- "This is 18-24 months of building, not a single good year"
- "The performance is consistent and expanding, not a spike"
- "What timeline and milestones would demonstrate sustainability to you?"

**Timeline Evidence to Reference:**
- **2023:** DynAMo pilot, Integrity admin, SIS training development
- **2024:** LARINT01 rebuild, Mark VIe resolution, Tiger Team contributions, budget ownership begins
- **2025:** Multi-site SME formalized, HUG presentations, training program expansion, 2025-2029 PCG planning

## How to Identify NEW Gaps (Ones You Haven't Prepared For)

### Listen for These Patterns:

**Pattern 1: Vague Concerns**
- "We're not sure you're ready"
- "It doesn't feel right yet"
- "We need to see more"

**Your Response:** *"Can you help me understand what 'ready' looks like? I want to make sure I'm addressing the right things."*

---

**Pattern 2: Red Flag Language**
- "You're just not leadership material"
- "The role doesn't really exist"
- "This isn't the right time" (repeatedly, with no timeline)

**Your Response:** Stay professional, but recognize this may be a culture fit issue. Ask: *"What would need to change for you to see me differently? I want to understand if this is a development issue or a structural constraint."*

---

**Pattern 3: Concerns About Something Outside Your Control**
- "We can't create a Lead role because of [org structure issue]"
- "Corporate won't approve new titles"

**Your Response:** *"I understand that's a constraint. If the title itself is the issue, is there another way to recognize the scope I'm handling—like a different role structure or interim designation?"*

---

## Emergency Response Framework (When You're Caught Off Guard)

### Step 1: Pause and Clarify
*"That's interesting. Can you tell me more about what you mean by [their concern]?"*

### Step 2: Acknowledge (Even If You Disagree)
*"I appreciate you raising that. I want to make sure I understand it fully before responding."*

### Step 3: Ask for Specifics
*"What would success look like in addressing that concern?"*

### Step 4: Respond with Evidence OR Commit to Development
- **If you have evidence:** "Here's what I've been doing in that area..."
- **If you don't:** "I hear you. Let's talk about how I can build that over the next [timeframe]."

### Step 5: Document for Follow-up
Take detailed notes. You'll address this in your post-meeting follow-up email and development plan.
