Senior Process Controls Engineer  
January 30, 2026

*Purpose: Seeking your recommendation on path forward*

---

## Slide 2: Today's Objective

**What I'm Asking For:**
- Your assessment of my readiness for Site Lead PCS Engineer role
- Identification of any gaps you see
- Guidance on next steps—whether that's a development plan or recommendation to PCG Technologist/Chris

**What I'm NOT Asking For:**

## Slide 3: How I Understand the Site Lead PCS Role

**Based on MPC's expectations, a Site Lead PCS Engineer:**

1. **Technical Authority:** Multi-site platform ownership, escalation point for critical systems
2. **Corporate Influence:** Shapes enterprise standards, represents site at corporate level
3. **Business Leadership:** Owns budgets, vendor relationships, strategic planning
4. **Crisis Management:** Leads high-complexity technical problem-solving
5. **Talent Development:** Mentors team, builds capability for the future
6. **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Aligns Operations, Engineering, IT, Safety, Finance

**Question for you:** Does this align with how you see the role?

## Slide 4: The Reality—I'm Already Performing at This Level

**Over the past 18-24 months, my responsibilities have expanded significantly:**

- Multi-site technical authority (Carson, Wilmington + supporting 3 external sites)
- Corporate alarm governance contributor (Tiger Team)
- Platform ownership (Integrity, DynAMo, Mark VIe, Safety Manager ecosystem)
- Budget/vendor management ($2M+ annual licensing, multi-year contracts)
- Training program development (Python, SIS, PLC—200+ hours delivered)
- High-risk crisis leadership (LARINT01 rebuild, Mark VIe restoration)

**I'm not asking to grow into this role—I'm asking for recognition of the leadership I'm already providing.**

---

## Slide 5: Evidence #1 - LARINT01 Integrity Platform Ownership

**The Challenge:**
- LARINT01 (Integrity Safety Manager) failed catastrophically in early 2024
- Complete loss of SIS lifecycle tracking, EPKS integration, compliance dashboards
- 10+ years of historical data at risk

**My Response:**
- Led complete server rebuild from scratch (6 weeks)
- Redesigned SFTP/SQL data pipelines for reliability
- Restored 99%+ uptime and audit-ready compliance
- Cost avoidance: $150K+ (prevented emergency replacement + contractor fees)
- Created comprehensive documentation for future support

**Leadership Demonstrated:**
✓ Crisis management under pressure  
✓ Deep technical expertise  
✓ Cross-functional coordination (Safety, Engineering, IT, vendors)  
✓ Strategic thinking (built for sustainability, not just repair)

---

## Slide 6: Evidence #2 - Corporate Alarm Governance Leadership

**The Challenge:**
- MPC needed enterprise-wide alarm management strategy
- Multiple sites struggling with alarm floods, ISA-18.2 compliance
- No standardized metrics or governance framework

**My Contributions:**
- **Active Tiger Team Contributor:** Proposed fixes adopted at multiple sites
- **Multi-Site DynAMo SME:** Deployed systems at Carson, Wilmington; supporting Salt Lake City, Detroit, Anacortes
- **Metrics Architecture:** Designed PI-based alarm metrics dashboards for executive visibility
- **Alarm Reduction:** 30-50% reduction at deployed sites
- **Standards Development:** Contributed to enterprise alarm management playbook

**Leadership Demonstrated:**
✓ Corporate-level influence  
✓ Multi-site technical coordination  
✓ Strategic thinking (enterprise standards, not just local fixes)  
✓ Executive stakeholder management

---

## Slide 7: Evidence #3 - GE Mark VIe Crisis Resolution

**The Challenge:**
- Gas turbine control systems experiencing repeated critical failures
- Controller lockups, HMI crashes, operator confidence eroded
- High risk: Near-miss unplanned GTG trips

**My Response:**
- Led root cause analysis (network latency, firmware mismatch, corrupted HMI files)
- Coordinated GE TAC escalation with detailed technical evidence
- Implemented remediation (firmware updates, network reconfig, HMI rebuild)
- Developed training program to address competency gaps
- Result: Zero unplanned GTG trips since resolution

**Leadership Demonstrated:**
✓ High-complexity problem solving  
✓ Vendor relationship management  
✓ Risk mitigation for critical assets  
✓ Knowledge transfer and documentation

---

## Slide 8: Evidence #4 - Budget & Vendor Strategy Ownership

**The Scope:**
- **Annual Licensing:** $2M+ across Honeywell, Schneider, GE
- **Strategic Planning:** 2025-2029 PCG budget (multi-year horizon)
- **Contract Negotiations:** 5-year Honeywell renewals, Schneider CFA, GE support agreements
- **Vendor Relationships:** Primary technical contact for escalations and strategy discussions

**The Impact:**
- Zero licensing lapses or surprise renewals
- Favorable contract terms through technical credibility with vendors
- Improved cash flow forecasting for Finance
- Strategic alignment of spend with refinery priorities

**Leadership Demonstrated:**
✓ Business acumen and financial responsibility  
✓ Strategic planning (multi-year horizon)  
✓ Vendor relationship ownership  
✓ Cross-functional coordination (Finance, Supply Chain, Engineering)

---

## Slide 9: Evidence #5 - Talent Development & Knowledge Transfer

**The Challenge:**
- New engineers need 12-18 months to become productive
- Tribal knowledge creates single points of failure
- Growing team needs structured capability building

**My Contributions:**
- **Structured Onboarding:** Created hands-on training labs (ACM, DynAMo, Integrity, Python, SIS, PLCs)
- **Mentorship:** 1:1 guidance for 5+ engineers (technical skills + career development)
- **Training Delivery:** 200+ hours across Python, PLC5/SLC/ControlLogix, SIS lifecycle
- **Documentation:** Built technical library with troubleshooting guides, system architectures, vendor contacts
- **Result:** 50% reduction in time-to-productivity for new hires

**Leadership Demonstrated:**
✓ Investment in team's future capability  
✓ Knowledge preservation (prevents tribal knowledge loss)  
✓ Strategic thinking (building pipeline, not just solving today's problems)

## Slide 14: Addressing the "But..."

**"The role is new—we're still defining it"**
→ I can help shape what this role should be based on the work I'm already doing

**"You need more corporate visibility"**
→ I'm actively contributing to Tiger Team, supporting 3 external sites, and representing MPC at HUG. Where do you see gaps?

**"You haven't been in Senior long enough"**
→ I've been performing Lead-level responsibilities for 18-24 months. What specific tenure benchmark are we targeting?

**"We need PCG Technologist alignment"**
→ Absolutely. What's the best way to engage them? Should I present directly or would you prefer to frame the conversation first?

**My Ask:** If there are gaps, let's make them specific and addressable—not vague concerns.

---

## Slide 15: The Path Forward—What I Need from You

**Today's Decision Points:**

1. **Assessment:** Based on what you've seen, where do I stand relative to Site Lead expectations?

2. **Gaps:** What specific areas do you see as gaps? (Technical skills? Corporate relationships? People leadership? Something else?)

3. **Next Steps:** What's the path forward?
   - **Option A:** Development plan to close identified gaps (with timeline and milestones)
   - **Option B:** Recommendation to PCG Technologist for alignment discussion
   - **Option C:** Direct recommendation to Chris (if you feel I'm ready)

**What I Commit To:**
- If gaps exist, I'll build a development plan and execute on it
- Continued delivery of Lead-level performance while we work through the process
- Open communication and receptiveness to feedback

---

## Slide 16: Closing Thought

**The Bottom Line:**

I'm not asking for a new role to be created.  
I'm not asking to grow into responsibilities I don't have yet.

**I'm asking for recognition of the leadership I'm already providing to MPC every day.**

The title "Senior Process Controls Engineer" no longer reflects the scope, complexity, or impact of my work. Formalizing the Site Lead role would:
- Enable clearer authority for decisions I'm already making
- Strengthen vendor and cross-site relationships with appropriate title
- Support succession planning and talent development initiatives
- Align my responsibilities with appropriate organizational recognition

**Thank you for considering this. I'm ready for your feedback and next steps.**
