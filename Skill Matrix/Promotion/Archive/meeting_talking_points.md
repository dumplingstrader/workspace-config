## Core Messages - What I Want Them to Understand

### 1. I'm Already Operating at Lead-Level Scope
**Key Point:** My current responsibilities have expanded significantly beyond Senior Engineer work

**Examples to mention:**
- **Multi-site ownership**: Primary technical authority for Carson, Wilmington, and supporting Salt Lake City, Detroit, Anacortes
- **Platform ownership**: Full responsibility for Integrity (LARINT01), DynAMo systems, Safety Manager ecosystem, GE Mark VIe
- **Corporate governance**: Active contributor to Alarm Tiger Team, working with multiple sites on alarm management standards
- **Budget/vendor management**: Managing licensing, contracts, and multi-year planning for PCG

**Sound bite:** *"Over the past year, I've found myself wearing the Lead hat more often than not—whether it's coordinating with corporate on alarm strategy, rebuilding LARINT01 after the failure, or managing our vendor relationships and budgets."*

### 2. I Bring Technical Leadership + Business Acumen
**Key Point:** It's not just technical work—I'm solving business problems

**Examples:**

### 3. I'm Invested in This Team's Success
**Key Point:** This isn't about a title—it's about formalizing the work I'm already doing

**Why this matters:**
- I'm training the next generation of PCG engineers
- I'm building relationships with vendors, corporate teams, and other sites
- I'm creating documentation and processes that outlast my tenure
- I'm representing MPC at industry events (HUG)

**Sound bite:** *"This role would let me continue the work I'm passionate about—building the team, strengthening our systems, and positioning Carson/Wilmington as leaders in process controls."*

## Final Mindset Reminders

1. **Listen more than you talk** - This is a conversation, not a presentation
2. **Be open to feedback** - Even if it's hard to hear, you want honest input
3. **Stay collaborative** - You're problem-solving together, not arguing a case

**Bottom line:** You're here to understand the role, get feedback, and align on a path forward. The goal is clarity and next steps, not necessarily a "yes" today.
