# Lead Process Controls Engineer - Gap Analysis & Response Prep

**Purpose:** Anticipate potential objections and prepare thoughtful responses

---

## Likely Gaps They May Identify

### 1. "You Haven't Been in the Senior Role Long Enough"

**Their Concern:**
- MPC expects people to spend 3-5+ years in Senior before moving to Lead
- You may lack depth/breadth that comes with time
- Rushing promotions can demoralize peers

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge:** "I understand tenure matters. Many Senior Engineers spend several years at this level before moving up."
- **Reframe:** "What I'd ask you to consider is the scope and complexity of what I've taken on—not just time in role. Over the past year, I've operated at Lead-level responsibility."
- **Evidence:** 
  - LARINT01 rebuild (crisis leadership)
  - Multi-site ownership (Carson, Wilmington + 3 other sites)
  - Corporate Tiger Team (enterprise influence)
  - Budget/vendor management (business leadership)
- **Ask:** "If someone demonstrated Lead-level performance for 12-18 months, what would make you comfortable recommending them?"

**Key Phrase:** *"I'm not asking to grow into the role—I'm asking for recognition of the leadership I'm already providing."*

### 2. "The Role Requires Corporate-Level Influence You Don't Have Yet"

**Their Concern:**
- Lead Engineers need visibility/credibility beyond the site
- You haven't built enough relationships with corporate teams, other sites, executives
- This is about organizational influence, not just technical skill

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge:** "You're right—corporate influence is critical for this role."
- **Evidence:** 
  - **Alarm Tiger Team**: Active contributor, proposed solutions adopted at other sites
  - **Multi-site SME**: Primary technical contact for Salt Lake City, Detroit, Anacortes DynAMo deployments
  - **HUG involvement**: Presentations, whitepapers representing MPC
  - **Vendor relationships**: Primary point of contact for Honeywell, Schneider, GE escalations
- **Gap acknowledgment:** "Where do you see me lacking corporate influence? Is it visibility with specific people, or experience in certain forums?"
- **Development offer:** "If it's about building more relationships, I'm happy to take on additional cross-site projects or corporate initiatives."

**Key Phrase:** *"I've been building corporate influence through alarm governance and multi-site support. Help me understand what additional visibility would strengthen the case."*

### 3. "The PCG Technologist Needs to Be Aligned, and We Haven't Engaged Them Yet"

**Their Concern:**
- This is a new role structure
- The PCG Technologist may have opinions on timing, readiness, org structure
- They don't want to recommend something that gets blocked higher up

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge:** "I absolutely understand the need for alignment with the PCG Technologist."
- **Clarify:** "What's the best way to engage them? Should I schedule a separate discussion, or would you prefer to include them in a follow-up conversation?"
- **Offer:** "I'm happy to present my case to them directly if that's helpful."
- **Ask:** "Are there specific areas where you think they'd have concerns?"

**Key Phrase:** *"I want to make sure everyone who needs to be at the table is involved. What's the best process for getting their input?"*

---

### 4. "We're Still Defining What This Role Is—It's Too New"

**Their Concern:**
- The Lead PCS Engineer role is new to the org
- They're not sure what the charter, scope, or expectations should be
- Promoting someone before the role is defined could create problems

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge:** "I understand this is a new position, and that adds complexity."
- **Reframe as opportunity:** "That's partly why I wanted to have this conversation—I can help shape what this role should be based on the work I'm already doing."
- **Evidence:** "Over the past year, I've been filling gaps that a Lead would naturally own: multi-site coordination, corporate governance, vendor strategy, training programs."
- **Ask:** "What are the most critical needs you're trying to address with this position? Let's work backward from there."

**Key Phrase:** *"If we're designing this role, let's start with the problems that need solving. I've been solving many of them already."*

---

### 5. "You Need More Experience with [Specific Technical Area]"

**Possible Areas:**
- Advanced APC/optimization
- Larger capital projects
- Specific control systems (e.g., TDC migration)
- Safety system audits/compliance

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Don't argue—ask for specifics:** "Help me understand what depth you're looking for in that area."
- **Evidence (if you have it):** Share examples of work in that domain
- **Development plan (if you don't):** "If that's a gap, what's a reasonable path to build that experience? Are there upcoming projects where I could take lead?"
- **Reframe:** "Is this a requirement for the role, or a nice-to-have? If it's critical, I want to prioritize it."

**Key Phrase:** *"I'm committed to continuous learning. If there are specific technical areas to strengthen, let's build a plan."*

---

### 6. "We Have Budget/Headcount Constraints"

**Their Concern:**
- Promoting you may require budget approval, headcount justification
- Finance may push back on salary increase
- Org may not have "room" for another Lead

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge:** "I understand budget is always a consideration."
- **Business case:** "I'm already doing Lead-level work—this is about aligning the title and compensation with the scope I'm handling. It's not about creating a new position."
- **Cost avoidance:** "Consider the value I've delivered: LARINT01 rebuild saved $150K+, vendor contract negotiations, training programs that reduce contractor dependency."
- **Ask:** "Is this a timing issue (wait until next budget cycle) or a fundamental constraint?"

**Key Phrase:** *"I'm not asking for a new role to be created—I'm asking for recognition of the work I'm already doing."*

---

### 7. "Your Peers Haven't Reached This Level Yet"

**Their Concern:**
- Promoting you creates internal equity issues
- Other Senior Engineers may feel passed over
- Org culture values tenure and "waiting your turn"

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge:** "I understand the need for fairness and team cohesion."
- **Differentiate:** "I'm not saying I'm better than my peers—I'm saying the scope of my work has expanded into Lead-level territory. If others are also performing at that level, they should be recognized too."
- **Evidence:** "I'm managing multi-site responsibilities, corporate governance, vendor contracts, and training programs. That's different from the work most Senior Engineers are doing."
- **Ask:** "If scope and impact drive promotions, how do we assess that objectively?"

**Key Phrase:** *"Promotions should be based on scope and impact, not tenure alone. I'm happy to be evaluated on that basis."*

---

### 8. "You Need to Demonstrate Sustained Performance, Not Just a Good Year"

**Their Concern:**
- One strong year doesn't prove long-term capability
- They want to see consistency over time
- Early success can be luck or timing

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge:** "You're right—sustained performance matters."
- **Timeline evidence:** "This isn't one year. I started building toward this in 2023 (DynAMo pilot, Integrity admin), ramped up in 2024 (LARINT01 rebuild, Mark VIe, Tiger Team), and continued in 2025 (multi-site SME, budget ownership, HUG)."
- **Forward-looking:** "I'm committed to continuing this trajectory. If you need to see another 6-12 months of performance, I understand—but I want clarity on what 'sustained' looks like."
- **Ask:** "What's the typical timeline you look for? And what milestones would give you confidence?"

**Key Phrase:** *"I've been building toward this for 18+ months, not just one year. If you need more time, let's define what success looks like."*

### 9. "We're Not Sure You Can Handle the People Leadership Aspect"

**Their Concern:**
- Lead Engineers often mentor multiple people, resolve conflicts, give difficult feedback
- You're technically strong but may lack people management experience
- They haven't seen you in challenging people situations

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge:** "People leadership is critical, and I'm still developing those skills."
- **Evidence:** 
  - Onboarding new engineers (structured training, 1:1 mentorship)
  - Training programs (Python, SIS, PLC5/SLC/CLx)
  - Cross-functional collaboration (Ops, IT, Safety, vendors)
- **Development offer:** "If this is a gap, I'm open to formal leadership training or coaching. What would you recommend?"
- **Reframe:** "I see people leadership as enabling others to succeed. That's what I've been doing through training, documentation, and knowledge transfer."

**Key Phrase:** *"I've been investing in people through training and mentorship. If there are specific leadership skills to develop, I'm committed to that growth."*

---

### 10. "You're Too Valuable Where You Are—We Can't Afford to Promote You"

**Their Concern:**
- You're the go-to person for critical systems
- Promoting you might mean you stop doing hands-on work
- They're worried about losing technical capacity

**Your Response Strategy:**
- **Acknowledge:** "I appreciate that you value my technical contributions."
- **Reframe:** "A Lead role doesn't mean I stop doing technical work—it means I'm recognized for the leadership and strategic work I'm already doing alongside it."
- **Evidence:** "I'll continue to own Integrity, DynAMo, Mark VIe, etc. The title change reflects the scope, not a role shift."
- **Ask:** "What are you worried about losing if I'm promoted? Let's make sure that doesn't happen."

**Key Phrase:** *"This isn't about stepping away from technical work—it's about formalizing the leadership I'm already providing."*

## Proactive Strategies to Mitigate Gaps

### Before the Meeting:
1. **Document everything:** Have evidence ready (budget docs, project outcomes, training logs)
2. **Anticipate their concerns:** Review this list and prepare talking points
3. **Get feedback from trusted mentors:** Ask peers/mentors where they see your weaknesses

### During the Meeting:
1. **Listen actively:** Take notes, ask clarifying questions
2. **Don't get defensive:** Stay open and curious
3. **Ask for specifics:** Turn vague concerns into concrete development items
4. **Propose solutions:** If gaps exist, offer plans to address them

### After the Meeting:
1. **Summarize in writing:** Send follow-up email with key takeaways, action items
2. **Build development plan:** If gaps were identified, create a plan with milestones
3. **Check in regularly:** Don't let this conversation go silent for months

## Mindset for Gap Discussions

✅ **"I'm here to learn and grow, not to prove I'm perfect."**  
✅ **"Gaps are opportunities for development."**  
✅ **"I want honest feedback, even if it's uncomfortable."**  
✅ **"Let's work together to close any gaps."**

❌ **Avoid:** "I don't have any gaps." (comes across as arrogant)  
❌ **Avoid:** "That's not fair." (sounds defensive)  
❌ **Avoid:** "Other people do less and get promoted." (undermines peers)

## Red Flags vs. Normal Concerns

### Normal Concerns (Can Be Addressed):
- Need more corporate visibility
- Want to see sustained performance
- Require alignment with PCG Technologist
- Specific technical experience gap

### Red Flags (May Indicate Deeper Issues):
- "You're not ready, but we won't say why"
- "The role doesn't exist" (even though they're discussing it)
- "We don't see you as leadership material" (vague, no evidence)
- "This isn't the right time" (repeatedly, with no clear timeline)

**If you hear red flags:** Consider whether this is a culture fit issue, and whether you want to invest more time here or explore opportunities elsewhere.

---

## Bottom Line

**Expect 2-3 gaps to be raised.** That's normal for a significant promotion discussion. The key is:
1. **Listen without defensiveness**
2. **Understand the specifics**
3. **Propose a path to close them**
4. **Get clarity on timeline and next steps**

**This meeting is a success if you leave with:**
- Clear understanding of role expectations
- Specific feedback on gaps (not vague concerns)
- A development plan or timeline
- Commitment to next steps (recommendation, follow-up, PCG Technologist meeting)
