## 6. Promotion Narrative ("I Am Already Operating as the Lead")

### The Case for Promotion: I Am Already Performing at Site Lead Engineer Level

Over the past three years (2022–2025), my responsibilities have expanded far beyond the Senior Process Controls Engineer role into the full scope of a Site Lead Process Controls Engineer. I am not seeking a promotion to grow into a new position—I am requesting formal recognition of the leadership role I already perform daily.

#### Multi-Site Technical Leadership (Site Lead-Level Scope)

I serve as the technical authority for process control systems across five refinery sites: Carson, Wilmington, Salt Lake City, Detroit, and Anacortes. This includes:

- **DCS Platform Ownership:** Experion PKS (multiple server farms), TDC 3000, GE Mark VIe gas turbine controls
- **SIS Lifecycle Governance:** Integrity Safety Manager (LARINT01), HIMA Safety Manager, Trident Trainer, Safety Manager databases
- **Alarm Management Leadership:** DynAMo deployment and support across all sites, corporate Alarm Tiger Team chair, Alarm CAB leadership
- **APC/Optimization:** Imubit advanced analytics, Aspen Plus OPM, Honeywell APO suite support

This is not a shared responsibility—I am the primary technical owner and escalation point for these systems.

#### Corporate-Level Strategic Influence (Site Lead-Level Authority)

My work extends beyond site-level technical support into corporate governance and strategic planning:

- **Alarm Governance:** I chair the corporate Alarm Tiger Team, define KPIs, establish metrics architecture in PI, and present findings to senior leadership. I wrote the alarm management playbook that is being adopted across MPC's refinery network.
- **Budget Leadership:** I own the 2025–2029 PCG strategic budget for process controls (over \$10M planning horizon) and manage over \$2M annual licensing spend across Honeywell, Schneider, and GE.
- **Vendor Relationships:** I negotiate multi-year contracts, manage renewals, and serve as the business relationship owner for critical vendors.
- **HUG Leadership:** I represent MPC in the Honeywell User Group, authoring whitepapers on alarm management best practices and presenting at regional conferences.

These are Site Lead-level responsibilities that require organizational influence, strategic thinking, and executive communication.

#### Technical Depth + Problem-Solving Complexity (Site Lead-Level Expertise)

I am the go-to expert for the most complex technical challenges:

- **LARINT01 Rebuild:** When the Integrity server failed catastrophically, I rebuilt it from scratch, redesigned the data integration pipeline, and established a sustainable lifecycle management process with obsolescence tracking and spare parts planning. This was a months-long, high-stakes project with zero tolerance for failure.
- **GE Mark VIe Crisis Resolution:** When gas turbine control systems experienced repeated controller lockups and HMI failures, I led the root cause investigation, coordinated with GE technical support, and implemented solutions that restored operational confidence.
- **DynAMo Multi-Site Deployment:** I designed the alarm management architecture, deployed DynAMo at five sites, integrated with PI, and built the metrics dashboards that executive leadership uses for decision-making.
- **OT Cybersecurity:** I resolved critical certificate issues in APO, led Carbon Black deployment troubleshooting, and coordinated with IT on UDC infrastructure upgrades.

These are not routine support tickets—they are high-risk, high-visibility problems that require deep technical expertise and cross-functional leadership.

#### Talent Development + Team Leadership (Site Lead-Level Mentorship)

I have built the training and onboarding infrastructure for the PCG team:

- **Structured Onboarding Program:** I designed hands-on training labs for Python, SIS, PLC5/SLC/ControlLogix that new hires complete in their first 90 days.
- **Mentorship:** I personally mentored 5+ engineers, providing technical guidance, career development coaching, and knowledge transfer on critical systems.
- **Documentation:** I created the technical documentation library that the team uses daily—system architectures, troubleshooting guides, vendor contact lists, escalation procedures.

This is not informal mentorship—this is deliberate talent development that ensures the PCG team's long-term capability.

#### Cross-Functional Leadership (Site Lead-Level Collaboration)

My role requires daily collaboration with stakeholders across Operations, Engineering, IT, Safety, Supply Chain, and Finance:

- I translate technical requirements into business cases for executive approval
- I coordinate TAR readiness with Operations and Maintenance
- I align OT/IT infrastructure upgrades with cybersecurity and network teams
- I manage vendor relationships that impact multiple departments
- I participate in strategic planning for control room modernization and infrastructure transformation

This level of cross-functional influence is a defining characteristic of a Site Lead Engineer.

#### Conclusion: I Am Already the Lead

The title "Senior Process Controls Engineer" no longer reflects the scope, complexity, or impact of my work. I am performing the full responsibilities of a Site Lead Process Controls Engineer:

- ✅ Multi-site technical ownership
- ✅ Corporate-level strategic influence
- ✅ Deep technical expertise on complex, high-risk problems
- ✅ Talent development and team leadership
- ✅ Cross-functional stakeholder management
- ✅ Budget authority and vendor relationship ownership

I am not asking for an opportunity to grow into this role—I am requesting formal recognition of the leadership I already provide to MPC every day.

**Key Message #5: Talent Development**
"I built the PCS onboarding program. I created the training labs. I mentored five engineers. I wrote the documentation library. This isn't informal mentorship—this is deliberate talent development that ensures the team's long-term capability."

**Key Message #6: Industry Leadership**
"I represent MPC in the Honeywell User Group. I author whitepapers and present at conferences. This external visibility reflects MPC's technical leadership in the industry."

**Closing Statement:**
"I'm not asking for an opportunity to grow into the Site Lead Engineer role. I'm requesting formal recognition of the leadership I already provide to MPC every day. I'm ready to discuss how we can make this transition official."

**Handling Objections:**

*"Do you have enough experience?"*
"I've been performing Site Lead-level work for three years. I own systems across five sites, manage multi-million-dollar budgets, and solve problems that no one else can. The experience is already there."

*"Are there gaps in your competencies?"*
"I mapped my performance against MPC's official Site Lead Engineer competencies. I exceed every requirement—multi-site authority, strategic planning, vendor management, corporate governance, mentorship. There are no gaps."

*"Can you handle the increased responsibility?"*
"I'm already handling the responsibility. I'm the technical authority for five sites. I chair corporate governance committees. I manage strategic budgets. The title just needs to catch up with the work."

## 14. Technical Depth Case Studies

### Case Study #1: LARINT01 Integrity Server Rebuild

**Problem:**
LARINT01 (Integrity Safety Manager server) experienced catastrophic failure in early 2024. The server hosted:
- Safety Manager SIF test database (compliance-critical)
- SFTP imports from HIMA Safety Manager
- SQL exports to EPKS work order system
- Historical SIS lifecycle data (10+ years)

Downtime risk: Loss of SIS compliance visibility, inability to track SIF test due dates, broken EPKS workflow integration.

**Complexity:**
- No current documentation for SFTP/SQL pipelines (tribal knowledge)
- Legacy Windows Server 2012 with undocumented custom scripts
- Multiple dependent systems (HIMA, EPKS, PI, Safety Manager client workstations)
- Zero tolerance for data loss (compliance audit risk)
- Tight timeline (Operations pressure to restore dashboards)

**Tony's Approach:**
1. **Assessment (Week 1):** Reverse-engineered existing SFTP/SQL architecture from failed server logs, interviewed previous admin (retired), documented current state
2. **Infrastructure Rebuild (Week 2):** Built new Windows Server 2019 VM, hardened for OT environment, configured SFTP/SQL services
3. **Data Pipeline Redesign (Week 3-4):** Rewrote SFTP import scripts (PowerShell), redesigned SQL export queries for EPKS integration, added error handling + logging
4. **Testing & Validation (Week 5):** Tested SFTP imports from HIMA, validated SQL exports to EPKS, confirmed PI tag integration, user acceptance testing
5. **Cutover & Documentation (Week 6):** Live cutover with zero downtime, created comprehensive documentation for future admins, trained backup support

**Result:**
- **99%+ uptime** restored (from complete failure)
- **\$150K+ cost avoidance** (prevented emergency server replacement + contractor fees)
- **Automated monitoring** added (alert on SFTP/SQL failures)
- **Knowledge preservation** (documented architecture for future support)
- **EPKS integration** improved (faster work order updates, real-time SIF test tracking)

**Lead-Level Evidence:**
- Crisis leadership under pressure
- Deep technical expertise (SFTP, SQL, Windows Server, HIMA, EPKS)
- Cross-functional coordination (Safety, Engineering, IT, vendor)
- Strategic thinking (redesigned for sustainability, not just repair)
- Documentation + knowledge transfer (prevented future tribal knowledge loss)

**Artifacts:**
- LARINT01 architecture diagram
- SFTP/SQL pipeline documentation
- Cutover plan + validation test results
- Email thread with Safety/Engineering/IT stakeholders
- Lessons learned document

### Case Study #2: GE Mark VIe Gas Turbine Control Reliability Restoration

**Problem:**
GE Mark VIe gas turbine control systems experienced repeated critical failures:
- **Controller lockups:** Spontaneous loss of control processor communication
- **HMI crashes:** Operator interface freezing during critical operations
- **EWS failures:** Engineering workstation unable to connect to controllers
- **Alarm floods:** False alarms triggering operational confusion

Impact: Loss of operational confidence in gas turbine controls, near-miss unplanned GTG trips, deferred maintenance due to unreliable monitoring.

**Complexity:**
- Intermittent failures (hard to reproduce)
- GE vendor support required (TAC escalation)
- Multiple failure modes (controller, HMI, EWS, network)
- High-risk environment (gas turbine trips = production loss + safety risk)
- Limited downtime windows for troubleshooting

**Tony's Approach:**
1. **Data Collection (Week 1-2):** Captured system logs from controllers, HMI, EWS; documented failure patterns; interviewed operators on symptoms
2. **Root Cause Analysis (Week 3-4):** Identified network latency issues (switch configuration), discovered firmware mismatch (controller vs. HMI), found corrupted HMI project files
3. **GE TAC Coordination (Week 5-6):** Opened TAC cases, provided detailed logs, coordinated remote troubleshooting sessions, pushed for priority support
4. **Remediation (Week 7-8):**
   - Applied GE firmware updates to controllers + HMI
   - Reconfigured network switches (VLAN isolation, QoS settings)
   - Rebuilt HMI project files (removed corruption)
   - Added monitoring (network latency alerts, controller health checks)
5. **Validation (Week 9-10):** Extended runtime testing (30+ days no failures), operator training on new HMI behavior, documented troubleshooting procedures

**Result:**
- **Zero unplanned GTG trips** (from multiple near-misses before)
- **Restored operational confidence** (Operations willing to rely on controls again)
- **Improved alarm clarity** (false alarms eliminated)
- **Documented knowledge** (troubleshooting guide for future failures)
- **Vendor relationship** (GE TAC now prioritizes MPC cases due to Tony's technical credibility)

**Lead-Level Evidence:**
- High-complexity problem solving (multiple failure modes)
- Vendor coordination + escalation management (GE TAC)
- Cross-functional stakeholder management (Operations, Maintenance, Engineering)
- Risk mitigation (prevented unplanned trips)
- Technical documentation (troubleshooting procedures)

**Artifacts:**
- GE TAC case files (detailed logs, correspondence)
- Root cause analysis report
- Network configuration changes documentation
- Operator training materials
- Lessons learned + troubleshooting guide

- Different site configurations (server farm sizes, network architectures)
- Integration requirements (PI for metrics, ACM for legacy callout)
- Corporate governance (Tiger Team, Alarm CAB)
- Stakeholder alignment (Operations, Engineering, IT, Finance)

**Tony's Approach:**
1. **Architecture Design (Month 1-2):**
   - Designed DynAMo server deployment model (centralized vs. distributed)
   - Defined data sources (Experion alarm journals, TDC system messages, Safety Manager)
   - Architected PI integration (alarm metrics tags, dashboard templates)
   - Documented network requirements (bandwidth, firewall rules)

2. **Pilot Deployment - Carson (Month 3-4):**
   - Deployed DynAMo server, configured Experion integration
   - Built PI dashboards (alarm counts, operator response time, rationalization status)
   - Trained local support (Operations, PCS)
   - Validated metrics accuracy (compared to legacy ACM)

3. **Multi-Site Rollout (Month 5-10):**
   - **Wilmington:** DynAMo + PI dashboards (replicated Carson architecture)
   - **Mandan:** Remote deployment with local training
   - **Dickinson:** Remote deployment + PI integration
   - **Anacortes:** Consultation + field report analysis for future deployment

4. **Corporate Governance (Ongoing):**
