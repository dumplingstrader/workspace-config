# Process Controls Value Tracking — Supervisor Briefing

**Purpose:** Brief supervisors on the value tracking pilot and request their support in data collection.

**Prepared by:** Tony Chiu, Senior Process Controls Engineer  
**Date:** January 2026

## Executive Summary

I'm piloting a methodology to systematically document the work performed by our Process Controls team. The goal is to create data-driven visibility into:

- **What we do** — Volume and types of issues handled
- **Where our time goes** — Breakdown by system, area, and root cause
- **What's NOT our job** — Issues we diagnose and hand off to other groups
- **Patterns** — Recurring problems that deserve attention

**I'm requesting your support to:**
1. Participate by running Copilot prompts on your own email (10-15 min/week)
2. Encourage your team to participate
3. Provide feedback on the methodology

## Why This Matters

### The Perception Problem
Process Controls is sometimes perceived as "not helpful" when we determine an issue isn't ours to fix. But that diagnostic work — figuring out what's actually wrong — is valuable and invisible.

### The Visibility Gap
Currently, we don't track:
- How many issues we handle
- How much time we spend
- What percentage are actually PC problems vs. other groups' issues
- Impact of project delivery quality on our workload

### The Opportunity
With data, we can:
- Demonstrate the value we provide
- Identify recurring issues that deserve permanent fixes
- Make resource cases based on actual workload
- Provide feedback loops to Projects on delivery quality

## How It Works

### Data Collection (Weekly)
1. Run a Copilot prompt on your sent emails (5-10 minutes)
2. Review and add your judgment (5 minutes)
3. Submit Excel file to shared location

### Aggregation (Monthly)
1. All submissions combined into master dataset
2. Patterns analyzed
3. Summary report generated

### Reporting (Quarterly)
- Team-level statistics (not individual evaluation)
- Root cause breakdown
- Time investment by category
- Recommendations for improvement

## What I Need From You

### Option A: You Participate Directly
- Run the Copilot prompts on your own email
- See what issues you're handling
- Takes 10-15 minutes per week

### Option B: Encourage Your Team
- Share the DATA_COLLECTION_PROCEDURE.md with your engineers
- Ask them to participate in the pilot
- Collect their submissions

### Option C: Both (Ideal)
- Your participation shows leadership buy-in
- Team participation gives comprehensive data
