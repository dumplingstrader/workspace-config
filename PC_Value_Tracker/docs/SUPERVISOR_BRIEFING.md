# Process Controls Value Tracking V2.0 — Supervisor Briefing

**Purpose:** Brief supervisors on the redesigned value tracking initiative.

**Date:** January 2026
**Version:** 2.0

---

## What Changed from V1.0

| V1.0 | V2.0 |
|------|------|
| "Prove we're busy" | "Demand specific changes" |
| 12+ fields per issue | 6 core fields |
| 7 different prompts | 1 unified prompt |
| Generic reports | Stream-specific scorecards |
| Defensive posture | Offensive posture |

---

## The Five Streams

Instead of tracking everything in one pile, V2.0 organizes work into **five streams**, each targeting a specific audience with a specific ask.

| Stream | What We Track | Who Sees It | What We Ask For |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Project** | AMP/capital project handoff failures | Projects team | PC acceptance gate before phase close |
| **Day-to-Day** | Routine support and troubleshooting | Leadership | Resource planning data |
| **Legacy** | Obsolete equipment issues | Capital Planning | Fund the obsolescence backlog |
| **Diagnostic** | Time diagnosing non-PC issues | Ops, Maintenance | Restore first-line troubleshooting |
| **After-Hours** | Off-hours calls and emergencies | HR, Leadership | Fair on-call compensation |

---

## Why This Matters to Supervisors

### 1. After-Hours Visibility (Stream 5)

**The problem:** After-hours calls go through supervisors but aren't tracked. Leadership doesn't see the off-hours burden.

**V2.0 solution:** Supervisors log after-hours calls. This creates visibility for:
- Staffing discussions
- On-call compensation
- Coverage planning

**Time commitment:** 2-5 minutes per call-out

### 2. Project Accountability (Stream 1)

**The problem:** Projects hands over broken systems and declares victory. Your team inherits the cleanup.

**V2.0 solution:** Track post-handoff issues by project/phase. Create a scorecard that shows:
- How many issues each phase created
- How many PC hours to remediate
- What percentage was preventable

**The ask:** PC sign-off required before project phases close.

### 3. Legacy Equipment Risk (Stream 3)

**The problem:** AMP deferred PLC upgrades. We're running 35-year-old equipment. When it fails, it's a crisis.

**V2.0 solution:** Maintain a Technical Debt Register showing:
- Equipment age and failure history
- Risk scores
- Replacement cost estimates

**The ask:** Fund obsolescence backlog before catastrophic failure.

## How You Can Help

### Option A: After-Hours Tracking (Minimal Effort)

Log call-outs as they occur:
- Date/time
- Who was called
- Issue summary
- Duration

This takes 2-5 minutes per call and provides critical visibility.

### Option B: Encourage Team Participation

Share the QUICK_START guide with your engineers. Ask them to:
- Run the weekly Copilot prompt (10 min/week)
- Tag issues with the correct stream

### Option C: Both (Ideal)

- You track after-hours calls
- Team tracks day-to-day work
- Combined data tells the full story

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ Individual performance evaluation
- ❌ Micromanagement
- ❌ Additional burden on overwhelmed team
- ❌ Another initiative that goes nowhere

## What This IS

- ✅ Data to demand specific changes
- ✅ Visibility into invisible work
- ✅ Evidence for resource discussions
- ✅ Accountability for project quality

---

## Outputs You'll See

### Monthly: One-Page Summary

Single page showing volume, trends, and key findings. Takes 5 minutes to review.

### Quarterly: Stream Scorecards

Specific reports for specific audiences:
- Project Handoff Scorecard → Goes to Projects
- Technical Debt Register → Goes to Capital Planning
- After-Hours Burden Report → Goes to HR/Leadership

## Timeline

| Phase | When | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Now** | January | Pilot with existing data |
| **Month 1** | February | First monthly summary |
| **Month 2-3** | March-April | Refine, expand if valuable |
| **Q1 End** | April | First quarterly scorecards |

## Questions?

Contact the project coordinator to discuss:
- How this fits with your team's workflow
- What level of participation makes sense
- How to handle specific situations

---

## Next Steps

If you're willing to support this:

1. **Indicate** which option (A, B, or C) works for you
2. **Start** logging after-hours calls (if Option A or C)
3. **Share** the QUICK_START guide with your team (if Option B or C)
4. **Provide feedback** as we refine the approach
