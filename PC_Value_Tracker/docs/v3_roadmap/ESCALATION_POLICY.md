# V3.0 — Escalation Policy

**Status:** Planning / Future Development

---

## Purpose

Define a formal escalation process for accountability records that don't receive timely responses. This creates a paper trail and ensures issues aren't simply ignored.

---

## Escalation Principles

1. **Professional, not adversarial** — Escalation is documentation, not confrontation
2. **Predictable** — Everyone knows the timeline and process in advance
3. **Documented** — Every escalation step is recorded
4. **Proportional** — Escalation level matches issue severity

## Escalation Ladder

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LEVEL 1: Direct Notification                                     │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── │
│ To:        Responsible party (e.g., Project Manager)            │
│ Timeline:  14 calendar days to respond                          │
│ Method:    Email with accountability record attached            │
│ If no response → escalate to Level 2                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LEVEL 2: Supervisor Escalation                                   │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── │

│ Timeline:  14 calendar days to respond                          │
│ Method:    Email noting "escalated due to no response"          │
│ If no response → escalate to Level 3                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── │
│ To:        Department managers (both sides)                     │
│ Timeline:  14 calendar days to respond                          │
│ Method:    Formal memo with full accountability record          │

│ To:        Plant leadership / Site manager                      │
│ Timeline:  No response required                                 │
│ Method:    Formal memo documenting unresolved issue             │

## Timeline Summary

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| 0 | Issue documented, Level 1 notification sent |
| 14 | If no response, escalate to Level 2 |
| 28 | If no response, escalate to Level 3 |
| 42 | If no response, escalate to Level 4 |
| 42+ | Issue marked "Unresolved — Escalated to Leadership" |

**Total timeline:** 6 weeks from initial notification to leadership record

---

## Response Options

At any level, the recipient can respond with:

| Response | Meaning | Outcome |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Acknowledged** | "We accept this happened as documented" | Record closed as acknowledged |
| **Disputed** | "We disagree with findings" | Document dispute, may require discussion |
| **Action Planned** | "We will take corrective action" | Document commitment, follow up on action |
| **No Action** | "We accept the risk and will not act" | Document risk acceptance |
| **No Response** | Deadline passed with no reply | Escalate to next level |

**Important:** "No Action" with documented rationale is a valid response. The goal is documentation, not forcing action.

---

## Escalation by Stream

Different streams may have different escalation paths:

### Project Handoff Stream

```
Level 1: Project Manager
Level 2: Project Director + PC Supervisor
Level 3: Capital Projects Manager + PC Manager
Level 4: Plant Manager
```

### Technical Debt Stream

```
Level 1: Capital Planning Analyst
Level 2: Capital Planning Manager + PC Supervisor
Level 3: Engineering Manager + PC Manager
Level 4: Plant Manager
```

### After-Hours Stream

```
Level 1: Operations Supervisor (for cause)
Level 2: Operations Manager + PC Supervisor
Level 3: HR Manager + PC Manager (for compensation issues)
Level 4: Plant Manager
```

## Escalation Notification Templates

### Level 2 Escalation

```
Subject: ESCALATION — PC Record #2026-037 — No Response from Level 1

This accountability record is being escalated because no response
was received from the initial notification.

Original Notification:
- Sent to: [Name, Title]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Response due: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Response received: None

Issue Summary:
[Brief summary]

Estimated Impact: $[amount]

We request a response within 14 calendar days.

Attached: Full accountability record

If no response is received, this will be escalated to department
manager level per PC escalation policy.
```

### Level 3 Escalation

```
Subject: ESCALATION (Level 3) — PC Record #2026-037 — Unresolved

This accountability record has been escalated twice without response:

Escalation History:
- Level 1: [Name] — [Date] — No response
- Level 2: [Name] — [Date] — No response

Issue Summary:
[Brief summary]

Cumulative Impact: $[amount]

We request your direct involvement in resolving this matter
within 14 calendar days.

If no resolution is reached, this record will be forwarded to
plant leadership as a formally documented unresolved issue.
```

### Level 4 Notification

```
Subject: FORMAL RECORD — PC Issue #2026-037 — Unresolved Through Normal Channels

This memo formally documents that the following Process Controls
issue was raised through proper channels and remains unresolved:

Record #: 2026-037
Issue: [Summary]
Impact: $[amount]
Preventable: [Yes/No]

Escalation History:
- [Date]: Notified [Name, Title] — No response
- [Date]: Escalated to [Name, Title] — No response
- [Date]: Escalated to [Name, Title] — No response

This record will be retained as part of the Process Controls
annual documentation. No further escalation is planned.

Should this issue contribute to a future incident, this record
will serve as documentation that the concern was formally raised.
```

---

## When NOT to Escalate

Escalation may be paused or skipped when:

- Recipient is on extended leave (adjust timeline)
- Issue is actively being discussed in another forum
- Organizational changes affect responsible parties
- PC management determines escalation is counterproductive

**Document the reason** for any deviation from standard escalation.

---

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Average response time | Are people responding faster over time? |
| Response rate by level | What % respond at Level 1 vs. requiring escalation? |
| Response type distribution | How many acknowledge vs. dispute vs. no-action? |
| Escalation rate by department | Which departments require more escalation? |

---

## Political Considerations

### Before implementing escalation:

1. **Brief your management** — They need to support this process
2. **Brief target departments** — No surprises; explain the system upfront
3. **Start with one stream** — Project Handoff is lowest political risk (external target)
4. **Frame as professionalism** — "We're creating documentation, not assigning blame"

### If you receive pushback:

- "Why are you creating bureaucracy?" → "We're creating accountability and documentation."
- "This feels adversarial." → "It's professional documentation. We're requesting responses, not demanding action."
- "We don't have time to respond." → "Acknowledged. No response is documented as 'No Response.'"

---

## Escalation Policy Approval

Before V3.0 implementation, this policy should be reviewed and approved by:

- [ ] PC Supervisor
- [ ] PC Manager
- [ ] [Optional] Target department leadership (informal buy-in)

*V3.0 — Silence is documented, not ignored.*
