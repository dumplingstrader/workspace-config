# Executive Summary: Honeywell BGP Plus Services - Strategic Improvement Initiative

**To:** Honeywell Process Solutions - BGP Plus Services Leadership  
**From:** Marathon Petroleum - Alarm Management  
**Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Re:** Strategic Partnership Enhancement & Service Excellence Initiative

---

## Executive Summary

Marathon Petroleum, as a premium BGP Plus service contract holder, has experienced **significant service delivery challenges across three recent site visits** (Anacortes WA, Detroit MI, and Salt Lake City). These incidents represent opportunities to strengthen technical competency, pre-visit planning, and quality assurance processes that will enhance our long-term strategic partnership.

**Key Observations:**
- **Salt Lake City:** Cleanup/merge operations resulted in data integrity issues affecting 1,200+ SCADA tags
- **Anacortes:** System health assessment findings; planned software upgrade deferred from original timeline
- **Detroit:** M&R collection functionality issues; client patching completion targets not fully met

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Opportunity to optimize resource allocation and planning processes
- Enhancement of technical validation procedures for complex operations
- Acceleration of BGP Plus program value realization
- Strengthening of system change management protocols

## Strategic Partnership Enhancement Initiatives

---

## 🎯 **PRIORITY 1: Technical Competency Development Program (Q1-Q2 2026)**

**Objective:** Establish comprehensive technical qualification framework for BGP Plus service delivery excellence.

**Requested Deliverables:**
- **Technical Skills Assessment Framework** - Detailed evaluation methodology for field personnel competencies
- **BGP Plus Qualification Standards** - Documented minimum competency requirements for complex system operations (upgrades, replication, production changes)
- **Training & Certification Program** - Structured curriculum addressing identified capability gaps
- **Resource Allocation Process** - Skill-matching methodology ensuring appropriate technical expertise for customer engagements
- **Complex Architecture Certification** - Specialized qualification process for advanced system configurations

**Strategic Value:** Establishes consistent technical excellence standard across BGP Plus service delivery, ensuring skill-appropriate staffing and reducing operational risks for all Marathon facilities. This foundational initiative supports long-term partnership success and customer confidence in service quality.

**Timeline:** Comprehensive plan by end of Q1 2026; phased implementation throughout Q2-Q3 2026

---

## 🎯 **PRIORITY 2: Enhanced Documentation & Knowledge Transfer Program (Q1 2026)**

**Objective:** Provide comprehensive technical resources enabling customer self-sufficiency and operational continuity.

**Requested Deliverables:**
- **Site-Specific Technical Guidance:**
  - **Salt Lake City** - SCADA tag data recovery procedures; validated cleanup/merge testing protocols
  - **Anacortes** - ACM R321.12.7 upgrade implementation guide; system feature restoration procedures; UTL channel diagnostics
  - **Detroit** - L4 ACM Web patching methodology; client update completion procedures; replication troubleshooting guide
  
- **Standardized Knowledge Base** - Repository of validated procedures, troubleshooting guides, and best practices
- **Remote Technical Support Protocol** - Dedicated technical assistance for completing deferred work items

**Strategic Value:** Empowers Marathon technical teams with self-service capabilities while reducing dependency on field visits for routine operations. Accelerates issue resolution and maximizes BGP Plus program value.

**Timeline:** Initial documentation suite by February 2026; ongoing knowledge base expansion Q1-Q2 2026

---

## 🎯 **PRIORITY 3: Pre-Visit Planning & Quality Assurance Framework (Q1 2026)**

**Objective:** Implement rigorous planning and validation protocols ensuring first-time-right service delivery.

**Requested Process Enhancements:**
- **Advance Planning Protocol** - Mandatory 2-week pre-visit access validation and site preparation checklist
- **Production Change Management** - Required pre-implementation testing and risk assessment procedures
- **Post-Implementation Validation** - Comprehensive system health verification before work completion sign-off
- **Quality Assurance Checks** - Systematic detection of non-functional features and data integrity issues
- **Customer Validation Process** - Formal post-visit review calls confirming system stability and customer satisfaction

**Strategic Value:** Prevents service delivery issues through proactive planning and systematic quality validation. Reduces rework, enhances customer confidence, and establishes predictable service outcomes. This framework protects both customer operations and Honeywell's service reputation.

**Timeline:** Revised protocols implemented by February 2026; mandatory for all BGP Plus engagements Q1 2026 forward

---

## **4. BGP Plus Program Evolution - Multi-Year Strategic Enhancement (2026-2027)**

**Objective:** Transform BGP Plus service delivery model to provide enterprise-level visibility and continuous improvement.

**Requested Program Enhancements:**
- **Cumulative Documentation Framework** - Standardized, living documentation maintained across annual visits per facility
- **Year-Over-Year Tracking System** - Longitudinal tracking of recommendations, implementations, and strategic deferrals
- **Historical Trend Analysis** - Multi-year data repository enabling ROI assessment and value demonstration
- **Knowledge Reuse Library** - Repository of validated configurations and successful implementations for enterprise-wide deployment
- **Performance Metrics Dashboard** - Quarterly reporting on service quality, customer satisfaction, and program outcomes

**Strategic Value:** Eliminates redundant documentation effort, enables data-driven decision making, and provides executive-level visibility into BGP Plus program value across Marathon's enterprise. Supports continuous improvement and long-term partnership optimization.

**Timeline:** Framework design Q1 2026; phased implementation Q2-Q4 2026; full deployment by Q1 2027

## Partnership Commitment & Next Steps

Marathon Petroleum seeks to strengthen our strategic partnership with Honeywell through **collaborative development of sustainable service excellence practices**. Rather than seeking remediation for past service gaps, we are focused on co-creating a framework for long-term mutual success.

**Requested Partnership Dialogue:**
- Acknowledgment of service delivery improvement opportunities identified across recent engagements
- Collaborative discussion of technical competency development program design
- Joint review of field personnel qualification and resource allocation methodologies
- Partnership approach to skill-matching for future Marathon engagements across enterprise
- Technical knowledge transfer and documentation enhancement roadmap
- Phased implementation timeline for planning and quality assurance process improvements
- Commitment to collaborative continuous improvement culture

**Proposed Engagement Timeline:**
- **Q1 2026:** Initial partnership dialogue; Priority 1-3 framework development
- **Q2-Q3 2026:** Phased implementation and validation of enhanced processes
- **Q4 2026:** Performance review and program optimization
- **2027:** Continuous improvement and expanded partnership opportunities
