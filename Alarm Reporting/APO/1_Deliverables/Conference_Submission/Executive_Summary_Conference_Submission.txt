Solving the Alarm Database Migration Challenge: A Practical Guide to ACM to APO Migration

With ACM End of Support on December 31, 2027, the alarm management community faces a significant transition opportunity. This presentation shares practical lessons learned from Marathon Petroleum Corporation's pilot implementations, helping organizations maximize the value of their APO investment and accelerate time-to-value.

Working with Honeywell's APO platform and migration tools, we've identified key success factors including strategic planning and database preparation, license sizing optimization, complementary methodologies that enhance APO capabilities, and realistic project timelines. The session covers enhanced synchronization approaches for improved operational accuracy, post-migration validation strategies, and sustained operational excellence.

This collaborative framework shares real-world insights on pre-migration assessment importance, strategic sequencing of migration activities, effective collaboration between operations teams and vendor support, and best practices for testing and user adoption. Our goal is to help peers achieve successful APO implementations by learning from early adopter experiences.

Target audience includes alarm management professionals, control system engineers, operations leadership, and project managers planning ACM to APO migrations.
