Quiz
I have followed DynAMo Guides, scheduled TagListGen, and ActiveSync, files are created, upgraded with no issue, all channels are green, all is good?
Maybe yes, maybe no. Definitely this is not the verification of properly configured sync!

===SLIDE 4===
Quiz
Should we properly test Active Alarm, Suppressed, and Shelved reports and escalate if any issues?
Who is ΓÇ£weΓÇ¥? What ΓÇ£properlyΓÇ¥ means?
(Barbara opinion) during project implementation we do NOT have timeΓÇª
Just at least make sure Sync is implemented ΓÇ£properlyΓÇ¥ΓÇª
I will tell you about several quality issues I am aware of (to set expectations) ΓÇª

===SLIDE 5===
Our goals (per Barbara)
Immediate goalΓÇª.
Close to Perfect Sync (add sync for shelvingΓÇª), No need for manual interventions (e.g. close open alarms, unsuppress, or unshelve from Web)
Eliminate ΓÇ£confusion periodsΓÇ¥
Reduce ΓÇ£-uselessΓÇ¥ events
Reduce OPC dependency
Short/Long term goalΓÇª
Remove OPC dependency
DynAMo-Generated events in M&R 
only when needed
Very Long term goalΓÇª
Eliminate sync for Honeywell systems (needs Experion+TPS fixesΓÇª TPS fixes not likely)
Do not focus exclusively on long term goals, first fix what is achievable short term=sync!





===SLIDE 6===
True or ΓÇªNOT? 
Active Sync for pure Experion is perfect
Suppression sync is perfect
ESVT Active Sync has only very few (documented) limitations
Just sync EST with ESVT and standard sync is perfect
Exxon does not complain about (ESVT\TPS) Active Sync (so this is a proof they are perfect)
Development is fully aware of the quality issues we have
If Customers do not complain we do not have issues
   (are they happy or discouraged\frustrated? )

We know how to implement and test Standard sync
We know how to troubleshoot Standard Sync
We cannot change the way we sync, new (BarbaraΓÇÖs) way is too complicated, we need developers to implement it



===SLIDE 7===
Summary of quality issues? 
Active Alarms report incorrect
Shelved report incorrect
Suppressed report incorrect
Overload of OPC
OPC failures or confusions (e.g. Advanced Security etc)
Confusing events generated in DynAMo
Wrong events generated in DynAMo
Confusing metricsΓÇª I think not what customer wants
DAS suppression
Priority suppression
ΓÇª.
Confusing columns with no meaningful info (Columns: shelved, suppressed, visible)
etc etc etc



===SLIDE 8===
BarbaraΓÇÖs terminology
ΓÇ£AlternativeΓÇ¥ ESVT\EST Active Sync
ΓÇ£Confusion PeriodΓÇ¥
ΓÇ£Waking up pointsΓÇ¥
ΓÇ£DynAMo generated eventsΓÇ¥ (unfortunately) include
	ΓÇ£ΓÇª-uselessΓÇ¥
	ΓÇ£ΓÇª-confusingΓÇ¥
	ΓÇ£ΓÇª-wrongΓÇ¥
	=ΓÇ£ΓÇª-excessiveΓÇ¥ (~95%)

Can we prevent them? Answer: only some right now, in future hope many many moreΓÇª so finally DynAMo will auto-generate events only when needed






===SLIDE 9===
ESVT ΓÇ£Unknown TimestampΓÇ¥ and quality
Only HF6 has the fix.
This is critical fix we need to deploy to all with ESVT systemΓÇª. Later we all will need to remove this fix (but not critical if you forget).

V9 of the rules go back to initial implementation (means without HF6ΓÇª it is bad performance as cache will be built since 1979)

Additional (unrelated) benefit of the trigger:
It may be used to prevent the creation of new pathsΓÇª





===SLIDE 10===
Active Alarms Quality (per Barbara)ΓÇª
Assuming Active Sync is configured rightΓÇª
(and unknown timestamp hotfix is implemented)ΓÇª
ΓÇ£accurateΓÇ¥ means DAS + shelved is accurate also
PROCESS ALARMS ():
Hybrid system: 60% quality degrades over time
better disable Active Sync
TPS system: 50% quality degrades over time
TPS (EJC): 93% quality degrades over time
ESVT:  90%.... if (1) unknown timestamp fix implemented and (2) consoles synced
In some casesΓÇª maybe better disable Active Sync without unknown timestamp hotfix
ESV: 95% (SYSTEM ALARMS: 70%)




===SLIDE 11===
Suppressed Sync Quality (per Barbara)
Assuming Suppressed Sync is configured rightΓÇª
DISABLE-ENABLE-INHIBIT:
70-99%, degrades over time
Causes DRASTIC load to the system. 
OPC other issues
DAS (partial sync with Active Sync)
90% process active alarms butΓÇªSystem tags are mostly wrong, alarms not in-alarm are often wrong
Overall - 50% as... Our reporting is NOT what customer wants
Priority (no sync)
This should by default disabled in our standard rules! 



===SLIDE 12===
Shelved Quality (per Barbara)
70% accurate but the cost of that is high:
Large number of ΓÇ£ΓÇª-confusingΓÇ¥ events
(+ΓÇ¥ΓÇª-uselessΓÇ¥ events)
For active process alarms quality >90% 
For active system alarms quality 60%

Before final testΓÇª understand thisΓÇª
ΓÇ£Confusion periodΓÇ¥
Confusion 1:
	~1-3 min for Active Sync
	~ 10 min for Suppression Sync
What is ΓÇ£Confusion periodΓÇ¥?
e.g. Suppression Sync takes 10 min to read all params

===SLIDE 43===
Final Test
Assign properly to Operating positions.
Check ΓÇ£UnassignedΓÇ¥ assets
Look at DynAssetsΓÇª (do the paths look right?)


Do not expect perfect for Active Alarms (due to time delay etc) but stale Alarms should be perfect

Why Alternative Sync?It is very simple functionality (one script) developed at the beginning of 2021.

Why new Sync? Can I use standard sync?
Experion standard OPC Active Sync Issues
Generally we think there are no issues butΓÇª
OPC load and connectivity issues
TimingΓÇª sync is processed before all relevant events are collected
Advanced security on Experion may make deployment unreasonably complicated\impossible
Dependency on OPC hierarchy settings (what if one day they will change it?)

No full shelve\DSA sync



===SLIDE 59===
Why new Sync? Can I use standard sync?
ESVT standard Active Sync Issues
Deals only with ΓÇ£ghostΓÇ¥ alarm but not with ΓÇ£missingΓÇ¥ alarms
DE was not aware of this issue! So we were constantly fixing ΓÇ£unfixableΓÇ¥
OPC load and connectivity issues
TimingΓÇª sync is processed before all relevant events are collected
Extremely complicated logic 
Realistically impossible to troubleshoot (or understand)ΓÇª
It is not WYSIWYG


===SLIDE 60===
Why new Sync? Can I use standard sync?
Hybrid system
There is no standard sync for Hybrid system
Until BarbaraΓÇÖs visit to LAR we were not aware of such setup 
New sync is the only option to get accuracy
Hybrid means that although Experion server is present still some areas are controlled by Operators in front of Native Window.
ASK the customer if operator is looking at Station or Native Window, where they ACK alarms?

===SLIDE 61===
Why new Sync? Can I use standard sync?
TPS standard Active Sync Issues
There is no OPC refresh to get active alarms for syncing. Can only validate alarms opened in M&R.
This really ONLY works against EJC collection (we only fixed alarmidentifier for EJC)ΓÇª still there are limitations
OPC load and connectivity issues
TimingΓÇª sync is processed before all relevant events are collected (I think there is undocumented way to address this)
Extremely complicated logic 
Realistically impossible to troubleshootΓÇª 
Many (Barbara included) still do not fully understand this functionality


===SLIDE 62===
Why new Sync better?
ACCURATE and less confusing that Standard sync whichΓÇª
Syncs after collection is fully done (thus not generating many ΓÇ£ΓÇª-redundantΓÇ¥ events)
Alarms with ΓÇ£UnknownΓÇ¥ timestamp ΓÇô ΓÇ£ΓÇª-wrongΓÇ¥ ReturnToNormal not generated(only HF6 gets factual timestamp)
Can validate the file (it is WYSIWYG, and not overcomplicated OPC logic)
We do not care about OPC options\struggles (e.g. hierarchy settings, OPC failures)
We do not care about Advanced security
ESVT can have ghost alarms, Sync validates them butΓÇª cannot validate some (ΓÇ£known limitationsΓÇ¥)ΓÇª No issue here
ESVT can have missing alarms ΓÇô DE was not even aware!... No issue here
-------
We do not have standard sync for Hybrid system
TPS ΓÇô only can validate alarms (cannot add\detect missing alarms) and only EJC works (as AlarmIdentifiers were only fixed for EJC! And sync was designed against this EJC collection wayΓÇª it will not work well with any other TPS collection methods)







===SLIDE 63===
Why Alternative Sync?
Quality!

Clarity! (vbs script so no logic hidden in executables)
	
Supportability!
   Simple Validation Logic WYSIWYG
				vs.				
Standard sync file (shown below) with ghost alarms, missing alarms and logic to the right impossible to understand


===SLIDE 64===
Active Sync HistoryΓÇª
HYBRID ΓÇô (Carson and Wilmington) Implemented first time with LAR in April
ESVT ΓÇô Robinson and Canton
GaryvilleΓÇª in progress
TPS ΓÇô Paulsboro (December)ΓÇª looks great but had significant issues with DynAMo (including cache corruption) soΓÇª just waiting to declare full success (or adjust if any issues identifiedΓÇª potentially may be related to invalid identifiers)

Quality of Active Alarms report will be consistently close to 100%. It will not deteriorate over time 



===SLIDE 65===
How complicated is new Sync?
Standard sync requires the customer to keep ESVTs in sync (very intrusive)
Standard Active Sync logic

custom DCSes scripts\implementation

(New Sync) TPS queries construction (should be  easy for the customers and definitely easy for Roy!!)




(New Sync) Hybrid (TPS+EST)




(New Sync) Pure TPS (small limitations, still way better than standard sync!)


(New Sync) ESVT 
(New Sync) Pure Experion 





Extremely Easy
Extremely Complicated

===SLIDE 66===
Will notifdmp return only alarms operator see?
No, it will return all alarms assigned to the console, users (e.g. operators) can be configured to see subset of these assets.

						

===SLIDE 67===
Quick Implementation:
Generate files on EST\ESVT\ESV (or TPS) and put in one location (can be network)
	- get all alarms (TPS alarms from TPS or EST, not from ESVT!)
Edit and Run ActiveSync_GenerateFilesForDynAMo to process files to generate ACT file (add one section per each channel)
	g_ChannelName="ESVT4"				
	g_ServerNames=Array("localhost","ESVT4")				
	g_AlmDmpPrefixes=Array("L4EST47","L4ACTSY","L4SEQSY") 
	call ProcessOneChannel()
Validate ACT file ∩âƒ WYSIWYG (check no DSA alarms)
Edit PPS (to adjust priority or path)
		(priority sample script at the bottom of ActiveSync_GenerateFilesForDynAMo)
Schedule Active Sync to process the files


===SLIDE 68===
HowTo new Sync?
1. Schedule files generation 5:00am

===SLIDE 74===
TODOsΓÇªConfusionsΓÇª What is leftΓÇª
General
What DE will\should fix? 
How far we should go with custom logic?
- Should we sync shelving? Should we fix other DynAMo limitations?)
We have to!
- Should we prepare ΓÇ£System ReportΓÇ¥
- PriorityΓÇª enhance for severity
TPS
Should we include sequence alarms? (<1% in LAR, none in Paulsboro).
NO
4. Adjust identifiers if needed (already adjusted for most important)
Suppressed Sync
Should we switch to file sync from OPC Sync? I know how to do this for TPS system, still did not figure out Experion (if I only can get few short answersΓÇª)



						

===SLIDE 75===
GOAL
Perfect sync!
Advanced Active Sync will eliminate the need for manual ΓÇ£close alarmΓÇ¥.

Unfortunately manual unshelve and unsuppress is still required (and some suppression activities are wrong)ΓÇª.

Perfect collection is very long goal and we should not concentrate on this (it requires Experion fixes)
